## Technical Decisions

### Architecture

- **Async First**: Use asyncio throughout for better performance
- **Plugin System**: Providers and tools as plugins
- ** Modularity **: We want to make this code as modular as possible so other projects can use self-contained pieces as APIs (without the need for our UI)
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints and mypy compliance
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test suite with mocked providers

### Dependencies

- **Core**: litellm, httpx, pydantic
- **CLI**: rich, prompt-toolkit, click
- **Storage**: sqlalchemy, aiosqlite
- **Web**: streamlit (optional)

### Configuration

- Follow XDG Base Directory spec
- TOML configuration files
- Environment variable overrides
- Per-project settings

### Versioning & Release Strategy

- Date-based versioning: `year.month.day.HHMM`
- Automated releases via conventional commits
- Continuous delivery on main branch
- No manual version management required

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy & Release Pipeline

- `main`: Stable releases (production-ready)
- `develop`: Integration branch (staging)
- `feature/*`: Feature branches (development)
- `fix/*`: Bug fixes

**Future Enhancement**: Implement dev → staging → stable pipeline

- Automated testing gates between stages
- Staging environment for pre-release validation
- Stable releases with semantic versioning

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for each provider
- Integration tests for CLI commands
- Mock providers for testing
- Performance benchmarks

### Documentation

- API documentation (Sphinx)
- User guide with examples
- Provider setup guides
- Contributing guidelines
