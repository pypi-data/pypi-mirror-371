# Documentation Templates

This directory contains templates for creating consistent documentation across the Coda Code Assistant project.

## Available Templates

### MODULE_ARCHITECTURE_TEMPLATE.md
Template for documenting module architecture with:
- Design documentation focus (architecture, not implementation)
- Evidence-based approach with GitHub-linked code references
- Line numbers hidden in comments (due to code drift)
- Architecture naming convention: `Architecture-{Component}.md`
- Standardized sections for comprehensive coverage
- Hidden verification checklist for maintainers

## Usage

When creating new architecture documentation:

1. Copy the appropriate template to your documentation location
2. Fill in all sections with actual code references
3. Verify all file paths and line numbers
4. Complete the verification checklist
5. Ensure all technical claims have citations

## Template Principles

- **Evidence-Based**: Every technical claim must reference actual code
- **Verifiable**: All references must include file:line format
- **Complete**: All sections should be filled or marked N/A with explanation
- **Maintained**: Templates should be updated as documentation needs evolve
