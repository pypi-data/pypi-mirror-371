# Agent and Tool Calling Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've successfully implemented an agentic tool calling system for Coda based on the OCI ADK (Agent Developer Kit) architecture. This implementation allows AI models to use tools to accomplish tasks through a clean, intuitive API.

## Key Components Implemented

### 1. Core Agent System (`coda/agents/`)

- **`agent.py`**: Main Agent class that manages the interaction loop between AI and tools
- **`decorators.py`**: The `@tool` decorator for marking functions as agent tools
- **`function_tool.py`**: FunctionTool wrapper that adds metadata to callable functions
- **`types.py`**: Type definitions (RequiredAction, PerformedAction, FunctionCall, RunResponse)
- **`tool_adapter.py`**: Adapter to convert existing MCP tools to agent-compatible tools
- **`builtin_tools.py`**: Collection of built-in tools (file operations, shell commands, etc.)

### 2. CLI Integration

- **`agent_chat.py`**: AgentChatHandler that integrates agents into the CLI chat flow
- Updated `interactive.py` to use the agent system for tool-enabled models

### 3. Documentation and Examples

- **`docs/agents.md`**: Comprehensive documentation for the agent system
- **`examples/agent_example.py`**: Working examples demonstrating agent usage
- **`tests/test_agent.py`**: Full test suite with 15 passing tests

## Architecture Highlights

### Tool Definition Pattern

```python
@tool(description="Add two numbers")
def add(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Add two numbers together."""
    return a + b
```

### Agent Creation

```python
agent = Agent(
    provider=provider,
    model="cohere.command-r-plus",
    instructions="You are a helpful assistant.",
    tools=[add, multiply, read_file],
    name="My Agent"
)
```

### Tool Execution Flow

1. User provides input to agent
2. Agent sends request to AI provider with available tools
3. AI decides if tools are needed and requests tool calls
4. Agent executes requested tools
5. Tool results are sent back to AI
6. AI provides final response incorporating tool results

## Key Features

- **Decorator-based tool definition**: Simple `@tool` decorator for creating tools
- **Automatic parameter schema generation**: Tools automatically generate JSON Schema
- **Async support**: Both sync and async tools are supported
- **MCP tool compatibility**: Existing MCP tools can be adapted for use with agents
- **Agent composition**: Agents can be converted to tools for use by other agents
- **Rich CLI integration**: Seamless integration with Coda's interactive shell

## Integration Points

- Works with any provider that supports function calling (currently OCI Cohere models)
- Maintains compatibility with existing MCP tools through adapter
- Integrates smoothly with session management and conversation history
- Supports all CLI modes (general, code, debug, etc.)

## Testing

All tests pass successfully:
- 15 agent-specific tests covering decorators, function tools, and agent behavior
- Integration with existing test suite maintained
- Mock provider used for deterministic testing

## Next Steps

The agent system is now fully functional and integrated. Future enhancements could include:
- Support for more providers with function calling capabilities
- Advanced tool permission management
- Tool result caching and optimization
- Enhanced error handling and retry logic
- Tool usage analytics and monitoring

The implementation successfully follows the OCI ADK patterns while adapting them to fit Coda's architecture and requirements.
