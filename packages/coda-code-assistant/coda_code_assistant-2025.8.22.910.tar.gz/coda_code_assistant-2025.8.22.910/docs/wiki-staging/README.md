# Coda Wiki Staging Documentation

This directory contains comprehensive documentation **staged** for the project wiki. All documentation should be written verbosely here - the wiki writer process will extract and format the most important information for the actual wiki.

**Note: This is NOT the wiki module itself, but a staging area for documentation that will be processed and added to the wiki.**

3. Update this README.md with links to new documents
4. Include:
   - Overview/purpose
   - Technical details
   - Usage examples
   - Troubleshooting tips

## Publishing to Wiki

These documents are designed to be copied to the project wiki:

2. Copy markdown files to wiki
3. Update internal links to match wiki structure
4. Add navigation and categories as appropriate
5. Remove documents from staging after publishing
