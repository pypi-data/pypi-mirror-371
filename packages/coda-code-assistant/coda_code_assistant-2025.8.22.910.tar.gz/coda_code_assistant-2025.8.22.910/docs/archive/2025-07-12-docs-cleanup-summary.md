Organized and cleaned up the docs/ folder to improve navigation and remove outdated content.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Folder Structure
- **`api/`** - API reference documentation (already existed)
- **`architecture/`** - System architecture docs (already existed)
- **`archive/`** - Archived outdated documentation
- **`development/`** - Development process documentation
- **`guides/`** - How-to guides and tutorials
- **`plans/`** - Planning documents (already existed)
- **`reference/`** - Feature reference documentation
- **`templates/`** - Documentation templates (already existed)
- **`testing/`** - Testing documentation
- **`wiki-staging/`** - Wiki staging area (already existed)

### 2. Archived Outdated Documentation
- Moved `phase8_modular_refactoring.md` and `phase8_summary.md` to `archive/phase8/`
- Moved `CHANGES_TODO_FIXES.md` to `archive/` (old TODO fixes already applied)

### 3. Consolidated Testing Documentation
Created `testing/` folder and moved:
- `TESTING_STRATEGY.md`
- `session_testing_guide.md`
- `LLM_TESTING.md`

### 4. Organized Guides
Created `guides/` folder and moved:

### 7. Created Navigation READMEs
Added README.md files to:
- `docs/` - Main documentation index with complete navigation
- `testing/` - Testing documentation overview
- `guides/` - Guide collection overview

## Results

### Before
- 27 files scattered in docs/ root
- Mixed content types (guides, references, outdated docs)
- Difficult navigation
- No clear organization

### After
- Clear folder structure by content type
- Archived outdated documentation
- README files for easy navigation
- Consistent organization
- All documentation easily discoverable

## Documentation Statistics
- **Organized**: 25+ documentation files
- **Categories**: 8 main sections
- **Archived**: 3 outdated files
- **New READMEs**: 4 navigation files

## Next Steps
- Continue to maintain this organization structure
- Archive documents as they become outdated
- Keep README files updated with new additions
- Consider further consolidation of wiki-staging content
