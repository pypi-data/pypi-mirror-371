This repository builds upon the original work by [PMeira](https://github.com/PMeira) at [AltDSS-Schema](https://github.com/dss-extensions/AltDSS-Schema), which aimed to define a structured JSON-based schema for DSS circuit representation. The schema has been packaged in this repository with slight modifications, enabling users to add the package as a dependency for downstream applications. This repository is actively maintained by [Tarek Elgindy](https://github.com/tarekelgindy)
