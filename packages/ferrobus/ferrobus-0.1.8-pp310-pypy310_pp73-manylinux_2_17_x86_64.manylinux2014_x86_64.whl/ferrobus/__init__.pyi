class IsochroneIndex:
    r"""
    A spatial index structure for highly efficient isochrone calculations in transit networks.

    Traditional isochrone generation involves computationally expensive geometric operations
    such as buffering network edges and performing unary unions on complex polygons.
    This approach often becomes prohibitively slow for interactive applications or
    batch processing multiple isochrones.

    `IsochroneIndex` solves this problem by pre-processing the transit network into a
    hexagonal grid system (H3 cells) that can be rapidly queried and merged during
    isochrone generation. This provides orders-of-magnitude performance improvements
    by avoiding expensive geometric operations at query time.

    Rather than working with precise network geometry during isochrone calculations,
    this index:

    1. Discretizes the geographic area into hexagonal cells
    2. Pre-computes network connectivity at cell boundaries
    3. Enables fast cell-based isochrone expansion
    4. Dissolves contiguous cells during final isochrone generation

    This approach trades some precision (based on cell resolution) for dramatic
    performance improvements, making it practical for interactive applications.

    Example
    -------

    .. code-block:: python

        index = create_isochrone_index(model, area_wkt, 8, 1200);
        isochrone = calculate_isochrone(py, model, point, departure, 3, 1800, index);

        # The resulting isochrone is a WKT string representing the polygon
        print(isochrone)
        >>> MULTIPOLYGON ((...))

    `TransitModel`

    A unified transit model that integrates both the street network (OSM) and
    public transit schedules (GTFS) for multimodal routing.

    This model serves as the foundation for all routing operations, containing
    the complete graph representation of both networks with interconnections
    between transit stops and the street network.

    Core components:

    - Street network for walking/access paths
    - Transit stops, routes and schedules
    - Transfer connections between stops
    - Spatial indices for efficient lookups

class TransitPoint:

    A geographic location connected to the transit network with pre-calculated access paths

    `TransitPoint` serves as the fundamental origin/destination entity for all routing operations.

    Raises
    ------
    `RuntimeError`
        If the batch routing calculation fails.

    Notes
    -----
    This function releases the GIL during computation to allow other Python threads to run.

    Computes a matrix of travel times between
    all points in the input set in parallel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    `transit_model` : `TransitModel`
        The transit model to use for routing.
    points : list[`TransitPoint`]
        List of points between which to calculate travel times.
    `departure_time` : int
        Time of departure in seconds since midnight.
    `max_transfers` : int
        Maximum number of transfers allowed in route planning.

    Returns
    -------
    list[list[Optional[int]]]
        A 2D matrix where each cell [i][j] contains the travel time in seconds
        from point i to point j, or None if the point is unreachable.
