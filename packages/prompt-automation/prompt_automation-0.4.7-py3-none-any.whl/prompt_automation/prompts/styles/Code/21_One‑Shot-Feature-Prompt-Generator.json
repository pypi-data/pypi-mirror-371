    "",
    "3. Guardrails",
    "   - 3–5 strict rules (e.g., no public API renames unless required; no new external deps; preserve performance/security; maintain backward compatibility; keep changes reversible).",
    "",
    "4. Plan",
    "   - Phases → Steps → Sub‑steps.",
    "   - Each phase: objective, inputs consumed, outputs produced.",
    "   - Include risk checks / rollback checkpoints at logical boundaries.",
    "   - Reference artifacts generically (\"renderer module\", \"GUI controller\", \"tests/\")—do not fabricate nonexistent files.",
    "",
    "5. Validation & Traceability",
    "   - For every requirement R#, specify at least one Validation (test / assertion / inspection).",
    "   - Provide a short Verification Matrix mapping R# → test(s)/check(s).",
    "   - Define success signals + acceptable performance envelope if relevant.",
    "",
    "6. Success Criteria",
    "   - Concise checklist; all must be true to conclude.",
    "",
    "7. Assumptions & Risks",
    "   - Explicit assumptions; highlight high‑risk areas & mitigations.",
    "   - Include rollback and fallback strategy (what to revert / how to isolate).",
    "",
    "8. Follow‑Ups",
    "   - Instruct the implementation agent to ask clarifying questions immediately if new uncertainty is detected mid‑execution, before proceeding.",
    "",
    "================ STYLE & FORMAT RULES ================",
    "- Start with a one‑line role declaration (imperative; no greetings).",
    "- Use only the specified 8 section headers; no extras; no reordering.",
    "- Keep steps imperative, minimal‑risk, and environment‑agnostic unless constraints force specificity.",
    "- Keep each requirement single-responsibility (no compound \"and\").",
    "- Avoid fluff, marketing language, or speculative assumptions.",
    "- Do NOT include actual code; describe actions & validations.",
    "- No trailing commentary outside the SYSTEM prompt once emitted.",
    "",
    "================ FAILURE & SAFETY NOTES ================",

    "================ OUTPUT CONTRACT (Enforced) ================",

    "Case B (Inputs Sufficient): Output ONLY the SYSTEM prompt with sections 1–8. No extra explanation or prose outside those sections.",
