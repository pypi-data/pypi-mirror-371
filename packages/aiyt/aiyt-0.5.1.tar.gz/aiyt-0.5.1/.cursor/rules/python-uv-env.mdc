- Only use `uv` for managing the virtual environment and package dependencies.
- Initialize and create the virtual environment with:
    - `uv init --python 3.12 && uv venv`
- Use `uv add` and `uv remove` to add and remove packages
- DO NOT use `uv pip install` and `uv pip uninstall` as it will not update the @uv.lock file
- Activate the environment with `source .venv/bin/activate` before running CLI commands installed by `uv add`.
- You may install or remove any packages as necessary using `uv` commands.
