flaskapp
============================================================
| Creating flask project one by one is very troublesome to ours.
| 'flaskapp' can create a empty flask project directly.
|

.. code:: sh

  $ pip install flaskapp
  $ flaskapp create your_project_name
  
.. code:: sh
  
  $ python your_project_name/app.py
   * Serving Flask app "app" (lazy loading)
   * Environment: production
    WARNING: This is a development server. Do not use it in a production deployment.
    Use a production WSGI server instead.
   * Debug mode: off
   * Running on http://0.0.0.0:80/ (Press CTRL+C to quit)
