"""
Text file utility functions for common file operations.

This module provides helper methods for working with text files, including
line counting, file previewing, and file loading capabilities. The TextFileHelper
class implements static methods for efficient file operations without requiring
class instantiation.

Key features:
- Line counting for text files
- File previewing with configurable line limits
- Complete file loading with header/footer skipping
- Streaming file loading with configurable chunk sizes
- Configurable whitespace handling and encoding
- Secure file path validation
- Resource management with context managers
