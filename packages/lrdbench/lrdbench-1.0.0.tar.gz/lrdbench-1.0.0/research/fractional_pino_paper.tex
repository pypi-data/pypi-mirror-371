\begin{abstract}
We present a novel architecture combining Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINOs) with fractional calculus for robust estimation of long-range dependence parameters in time series data. Our approach integrates Fourier Neural Operators (FNOs) with multi-scale feature extraction and physics-informed constraints, creating the first neural operator framework specifically designed for fractional parameter estimation. The architecture demonstrates significant advantages over classical methods through its ability to learn scale-invariant features and incorporate physical constraints in the spectral domain. We provide comprehensive theoretical analysis and demonstrate the framework's capabilities through extensive benchmarking against classical estimators.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background and Motivation}

Long-range dependence (LRD) in time series data is a fundamental property observed across numerous domains including neuroscience, finance, geophysics, and telecommunications. The Hurst exponent (H) serves as the primary measure of LRD, quantifying the degree of persistence or anti-persistence in temporal correlations. Traditional estimation methods, including Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (DFA), Rescaled Range Analysis (R/S), and spectral methods, face significant challenges when dealing with contaminated or non-stationary data.

Recent advances in deep learning have introduced Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) as a promising approach for parameter estimation in scientific computing. However, existing PINN architectures lack the operator learning capabilities necessary for efficient function-to-function mapping in time series analysis.

\section{Related Work}

\subsection{Neural Operators and Fourier Neural Networks}

Neural operators represent a significant advancement in deep learning for scientific computing, enabling learning of mappings between function spaces. The Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) introduced by Li et al. [2020] demonstrated remarkable efficiency in learning solution operators for partial differential equations through spectral convolution in the Fourier domain. Our work extends this framework to fractional calculus applications.

\subsection{Physics-Informed Neural Networks}

PINNs have emerged as a powerful paradigm for incorporating physical laws into neural network training. Raissi et al. [2019] established the foundation for physics-informed learning, while subsequent work has extended this to various domains. Our contribution lies in the integration of physics constraints with neural operator architectures.

\subsection{Fractional Parameter Estimation}

Classical methods for Hurst exponent estimation include DFA, R/S analysis, and spectral methods. While effective on clean data, these methods suffer from sensitivity to contamination and non-stationarity. Recent work has explored machine learning approaches, but none have incorporated the operator learning capabilities or physics-informed constraints of our framework.

        self.weights = nn.Parameter(
            self.scale * torch.rand(in_channels, out_channels, modes, dtype=torch.cfloat)
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        # FFT → Weight multiplication → IFFT
        x_ft = torch.fft.rfft(x)
        out_ft = torch.einsum("bix,iox->box", x_ft, self.weights)
        return torch.fft.irfft(out_ft, n=x.shape[-1])

self.multi_scale_layers = nn.ModuleList([
    nn.Conv1d(hidden_dims[-1], hidden_dims[-1], kernel_size=k, padding=k//2)
    for k in [3, 5, 7, 11]  # Multi-scale kernels
])

self.scale_attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(
    embed_dim=hidden_dims[-1], num_heads=4, batch_first=True
)
\end{lstlisting}
