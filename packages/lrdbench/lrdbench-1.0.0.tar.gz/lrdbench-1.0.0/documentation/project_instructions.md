# DATA MODELLING AND GENERATION PROJECT

## In this project, I would like to explore synthetic data generation, and technqiues for generating high-quality synthetic data. this is the main focus. The aim is to create a repo of methods for modelling data and generating synthetic data systematically. Everything should be documented, models, data, issues, fixes, etc.

# If you think there is a better way to do something, you should let me know and we can discuss and come to a conclusion.

    1. Create a new virtaul environment for this project. 
    2. The models I am interested in are ARFIMA, fBm, fGn, and MRW.
    3. Create a folder called models and one called tests for the model implementation and testing respectively. Models should have sub folders data_models and estimators.
    4. Create a folder called analysis for statistical data characteristics, estimation and validation (including cross-validation) results from each model type. 
    5. We should have different categories of estimators: temporal (DFA, R/S, Higuchi, DMA), spectral (Periodogram, Whittle, GPH), wavelet (Wavelet Log Variance, Wavelet Variance, Wavelet Whittle, CWT), multifractal (MFDFA, Multifractal Wavelet Leaders), high-performance (hosting JAX/NUMBA optimised versions of each estimator). Later models will include machine learning based models.
    6. Create a folder called documentation that stores comprehensive documentation of each model, estimator and API references, and another folder called results/plots that store example plots for the models.  
    7. Create another folder called research_reference where we collect research papers related to all the work we do in this project. Keep this updated as we go along.
    8. Let's add the ability to add real-world confounds to each data model and run estimation and statistical analysis on the contaminated model. We should be able to simulate various types time series by careful selection of base model with specific combinations of contaminants. Let's create a libary of different types of complex time series (e.g. heavy-tailedwith non-stationary trend, or multidimensional with fractal properties, or irregular sampled with artefact, etc)
    9. Let's encapsulate the simulating/plotting of data models; define a method for simulate data in the base_model, and a config that governs global plotting specifications.
    10. Create a folder called demos where we host a variety of demo scripts to showcase various tasks.
    11. Let's include data generators based on neural fSDEs in this development cycle. You can see works by Hayashi & Nakagawa (2022, 2024) on neural fSDEs and Latent fSDEs for specific details.
