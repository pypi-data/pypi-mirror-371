DevOps Practices and Tools

Continuous Integration (CI)
The practice of merging code changes frequently into a shared repository. Each merge triggers automated builds and tests to detect integration issues early.

Key CI Tools:
- Jenkins: Open-source automation server
- GitLab CI: Integrated with GitLab repositories
- GitHub Actions: Native GitHub CI/CD
- CircleCI: Cloud-based CI/CD platform
- Travis CI: Distributed build platform

Continuous Deployment (CD)
Automatically deploying code changes to production after passing all tests. Enables rapid and reliable software delivery.

Configuration Management:
- Ansible: Agentless automation tool
- Puppet: Infrastructure as code
- Chef: Infrastructure automation
- Terraform: Infrastructure provisioning

Containerization:
- Docker: Container platform
- Kubernetes: Container orchestration
- Docker Compose: Multi-container applications
- Helm: Kubernetes package manager

Monitoring and Logging:
- Prometheus: Metrics collection
- Grafana: Visualization dashboards
- ELK Stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana
- Datadog: Cloud monitoring
- New Relic: Application performance monitoring

Version Control:
- Git: Distributed version control
- Git Flow: Branching model
- GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket: Repository hosting

Best Practices:
1. Automate everything possible
2. Version control all configurations
3. Monitor continuously
4. Implement security at every stage
5. Foster collaboration between teams
6. Embrace failure and learn from it
