## üìù Session Notes

### Key Decisions Made:
1. **Project Name:** zaiq
2. **Initial Target:** Individual developers and small teams
3. **Phased Approach:** Start with single-user, expand to team sharing
4. **Documentation Strategy:** Separate files for easy VS Code review

### Open Questions:
1. How granular should DAG dependencies be?
2. Security model for SSH keys?
3. Story format standardization?
4. Error handling and retry logic?

### Ideas Captured:
- DAG visualization for story dependencies
- Time-block marketplace for unused capacity
- Docker deployment for easy setup
- BMAD integration for structured development
