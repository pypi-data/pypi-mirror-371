## Executive Summary

**zaiq** is a Docker-deployable service that automates software development tasks by distributing BMAD-structured stories to remote AI instances, managing dependencies through DAG visualization, and eventually enabling time-block sharing between team members.

**Key Value:** Transform idle AI time blocks into productive development capacity through intelligent task distribution and dependency management.

**Target Market:** Individual developers and small teams using AI coding assistants who need to maximize their AI-assisted development capacity.

**Unique Position:** First solution specifically designed for AI coding constraints with BMAD methodology integration and time-block marketplace capabilities.

## Problem Statement

Development teams face artificial productivity constraints from AI usage limits (rate limits, usage caps, API quotas) despite having well-defined work ready for automation. This creates:

- **60% productivity loss** from unused capacity
- **$66-100 effective hourly cost** vs $20 at full utilization  
- **40% of sprints missing deadlines** due to AI capacity constraints

Existing CI/CD tools aren't AI-aware, project management tools can't execute stories, and custom scripts lack standardization and security.

## Proposed Solution

zaiq acts as an intelligent orchestration layer between BMAD-structured backlogs and available AI coding instances. 

**Core Capabilities:**
- Automatic story distribution based on dependencies
- Visual DAG for dependency management
- Git-native integration with SSH security
- Docker deployment for easy setup
- Time-block marketplace for capacity sharing (Phase 2)

**Why It Will Succeed:**
- Solves immediate pain points with measurable ROI
- Leverages existing BMAD methodology
- Network effects from team capacity sharing
- First-mover advantage in untapped market

## Target Users

**Primary Segments:**
1. **Individual AI Power Users** - Developers hitting usage limits regularly
2. **Small Development Teams (2-10)** - Teams wanting to pool capacity

**Secondary Segments:**
- Freelance developers managing multiple projects
- Open source maintainers with volunteer contributors
- Early-stage startups maximizing limited resources

**Anti-Personas:**
- Large enterprises (initially)
- Non-technical users
- Teams not using BMAD/Agile
