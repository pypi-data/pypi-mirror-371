- Increase story completion rate by 3x
- Eliminate manual story tracking overhead
- Achieve seamless context preservation across sessions

**User Journey:**
1. Hits AI usage limit on Monday morning
2. Has 15 BMAD stories ready for development
3. Deploys zaiq with Docker command
4. Loads stories into queue with dependency visualization
5. zaiq automatically executes stories when capacity becomes available
6. Receives notifications when stories complete or encounter issues

### 2. Small Development Teams (2-10 developers)
**Profile:** Agile teams using AI coding assistants where some members have unused capacity while others are blocked.

**Characteristics:**
- Mixed AI usage patterns across team members
- Using BMAD/Agile methodologies consistently
- Working on shared repositories with branching strategies
- Have established code review and CI/CD processes
- Team lead interested in capacity optimization

**Pain Points:**
- Uneven Claude usage distribution across team
- No visibility into team-wide capacity utilization
- Waiting for specific team member's Claude time to reset
- Duplicate effort when multiple people work on similar stories
- Difficult to coordinate AI-assisted development tasks

**Success Criteria:**
- Achieve 70%+ team-wide capacity utilization
- Reduce average story wait time from days to hours
- Enable transparent capacity sharing without friction
- Maintain code quality and review standards

**User Journey:**
1. Team of 5 developers, 3 have unused AI time, 2 are blocked
2. Team lead deploys zaiq for shared project
3. All team members contribute their unused time blocks to shared pool
4. High-priority stories get executed first using available capacity
5. Results flow through normal code review process
6. Team dashboard shows utilization and queue status

### 5. Startup Engineering Teams
**Profile:** Early-stage startups moving fast with limited resources but high technical debt accumulation risk.

**Characteristics:**
- Small teams (3-8 engineers) wearing multiple hats
- High feature velocity requirements
- Limited budget for tooling but high ROI sensitivity
- Strong emphasis on moving fast and iteration

**Pain Points:**
- Cannot afford unused AI capacity
- Need maximum development velocity
- Risk accumulating technical debt at high speed
- Limited time for process optimization

**Value Proposition:**
- Maximum ROI on existing AI subscriptions

## Anti-Personas (Not Target Users)

### 1. Large Enterprise Teams (50+ developers)
**Why not initially:** 
- Complex enterprise requirements (SSO, compliance, audit trails)
- Procurement processes too slow for early adoption
- Need extensive customization that complicates MVP
- Risk-averse culture may resist new tools

**Future consideration:** Phase 3 expansion opportunity

### 2. Non-Technical Users
**Why not:**
- CDO requires understanding of Git, Docker, and development workflows
- Target problem is specific to technical development tasks
- Limited ability to contribute meaningful feedback for technical features

### 3. Teams Not Using AI Coding Assistants
**Why not:**
- Primary value proposition is AI-specific optimization
- Different AI tools have different constraints and capabilities
- Focus needed to build deep AI integration
