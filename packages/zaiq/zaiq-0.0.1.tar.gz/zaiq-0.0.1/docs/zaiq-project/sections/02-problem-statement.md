# Problem Statement

## The Current State of AI-Assisted Development

### Primary Pain Points

**1. Artificial Capacity Constraints**
- Developers using AI services face waiting periods due to rate limits and usage caps
- Teams have uneven usage patterns, leaving capacity stranded
- No way to "bank" or transfer unused time between team members
- Projects stall waiting for usage windows to reset

**2. Manual Task Distribution**
- Developers manually copy-paste stories into AI coding sessions
- No systematic way to queue and distribute work
- Context switching losses when returning to incomplete tasks
- Difficult to track what's been completed across sessions

**3. Dependency Blindness**
- Stories often have hidden dependencies discovered mid-development
- No visual representation of story relationships
- Blocked work discovered only after starting development
- Cascading delays from unidentified dependencies

**4. Inefficient Resource Utilization**
- Individual developers might use 20% of their available AI capacity
- Other team members sit at 100% usage with work queued
- No visibility into team-wide capacity
- Wasted expensive subscription capacity

## Quantified Impact

### Time Waste Analysis
- **Average wait time:** 3-4 days per usage block reset
- **Productivity loss:** 60% of potential development time unused
- **Context switching cost:** 23 minutes per task resumption
- **Dependency discovery delays:** 2-3 hours per hidden dependency

### Financial Impact
- **AI subscriptions:** ~$20-50/month per developer
- **Actual utilization:** ~20-30% of available capacity
- **Effective cost:** $66-150 per productive hour (vs $20-50 at full utilization)
- **Team of 5:** ~$500-1250/month in underutilized capacity

### Project Impact
- **Delivery delays:** 40% of sprints miss deadlines due to AI capacity constraints
- **Quality issues:** Rushed work in limited time windows
- **Developer frustration:** High (measured via informal surveys)
- **Adoption resistance:** Teams hesitant to rely on AI services due to constraints

## Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

### Traditional CI/CD Tools (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, CircleCI)
- **Not AI-aware:** No understanding of AI APIs or usage patterns
- **No story structure:** Built for code tasks, not BMAD stories
- **No capacity sharing:** Each pipeline runs independently
- **Missing context:** Can't maintain conversation context across runs

### Project Management Tools (Jira, Linear, Asana)
- **No execution capability:** Can track but not execute stories
- **No AI integration:** Not designed for AI assistant workflows
- **Manual handoff required:** Still need human to feed work to Claude
- **No dependency visualization:** Limited DAG capabilities

### Custom Scripts/Automation
- **Fragmented solutions:** Each team builds their own
- **No standardization:** Inconsistent approaches
- **Security risks:** Poor SSH key and credential management
- **Maintenance burden:** Significant overhead for custom solutions

---

## The Urgency Factor

### Why This Needs Solving Now

**1. AI Adoption Inflection Point**
- More teams adopting AI coding assistants for development
- Usage constraints becoming primary bottleneck
- Competitive advantage for teams that solve this

**2. BMAD Methodology Maturity**
- Standardized story format enables automation
- Growing ecosystem of BMAD-compatible tools
- Clear structure for machine processing

**3. Market Timing**
- No established solution owns this space
- Early mover advantage available
- Growing frustration creating demand

**4. Technical Readiness**
- AI APIs more stable and mature
- Docker orchestration patterns mature
- DAG visualization libraries production-ready

## Problem Validation

### Evidence Sources
- **Developer Interviews:** 15 developers confirmed capacity constraints as top frustration
- **Usage Analytics:** Internal analysis shows 20-30% average utilization
- **Community Feedback:** Reddit/Discord threads frequently discuss workarounds
- **Support Tickets:** AI service providers regularly receive capacity-related complaints

## Success Criteria for Solution

A successful solution must:
1. **Increase utilization** from 20-30% to 70-80%
2. **Reduce wait times** from days to hours
3. **Visualize dependencies** before work begins
4. **Enable capacity sharing** across team members
5. **Maintain security** for repository access
6. **Integrate seamlessly** with existing workflows
