## Explicitly Out of Scope (Not in MVP)

### Advanced Features for Future Versions

#### Web User Interface
**Rationale:** CLI-first approach reduces complexity and development time for MVP. Web UI requires additional frontend development, authentication system, and deployment complexity.

**Future Timeline:** Beta release (Month 2-3)

#### Multi-User Support & Team Features
**Rationale:** Single-user Docker deployment is significantly simpler than multi-tenant architecture. Team features require user management, permissions, and collaborative workflows.

**Future Timeline:** GA release (Month 4-6)

#### Time Block Sharing & Marketplace
**Rationale:** Core value proposition depends on basic story execution working reliably. Sharing features require complex coordination mechanisms and user trust systems.

**Future Timeline:** Post-MVP expansion (Month 6+)

#### Advanced DAG Visualization
**Rationale:** While dependency management is core, sophisticated visualization requires significant frontend development and may not be essential for proving core value.

**Future Timeline:** Beta release (Month 2-3)

#### Enterprise Features
**Rationale:** MVP focuses on individual developer adoption. Enterprise features (SSO, audit logs, compliance) add significant complexity without validating core assumptions.

**Future Timeline:** Enterprise release (Month 8+)

#### Analytics Dashboard
**Rationale:** Basic logging provides essential debugging information. Comprehensive analytics require additional data infrastructure and may distract from core functionality.

**Future Timeline:** GA release (Month 4-6)

#### Integration Ecosystem
**Rationale:** While valuable for adoption, integrations with external tools (Jira, Linear, etc.) require partnerships and additional maintenance overhead.

**Future Timeline:** Post-GA expansion (Month 6+)

### Technical Scope Limitations

#### Multi-Repository Support
**MVP Limitation:** Single repository per zaiq instance
**Rationale:** Reduces configuration complexity and potential conflicts
**Future Enhancement:** Multi-repo support with workspace management

#### Advanced Branching Strategies
**MVP Limitation:** Simple feature branch per story
**Rationale:** Avoids complexity of Git flow, environment management
**Future Enhancement:** Customizable branching strategies and environments

#### Story Format Variations
**MVP Limitation:** Strict BMAD format requirements
**Rationale:** Reduces parsing complexity and edge cases
**Future Enhancement:** Support for alternative story formats and templates

#### Performance Optimization
**MVP Limitation:** Sequential story processing within dependencies
**Rationale:** Simpler implementation and debugging
**Future Enhancement:** Advanced parallel processing and resource optimization

#### Comprehensive Error Recovery
**MVP Limitation:** Basic retry logic and manual intervention for complex failures
**Rationale:** Full automation of edge cases is time-intensive
**Future Enhancement:** AI-powered error analysis and automatic resolution
