# Goals & Metrics

## Strategic Business Objectives

### 1. Maximize AI Development Capacity Utilization
**Objective:** Transform underutilized AI subscriptions into productive development capacity across the developer ecosystem.

**Current State:**
- Individual developers utilize 20-35% of available AI capacity
- Team environments see 15-25% utilization rates
- ~$2.4M in unused AI capacity annually (estimated 120K users @ $20/month, 70% underutilization)

**Target State:**
- Individual users achieve 70-80% capacity utilization
- Team environments reach 65-75% utilization through sharing
- Reduce industry-wide unused capacity by 60%

### 2. Establish zaiq as the Standard for AI-Assisted Development Orchestration
**Objective:** Become the de facto platform for managing and optimizing AI development workflows.

**Market Position Goals:**
- Capture 25% of active AI coding assistant user base within 18 months
- Build ecosystem of integrations with major development tools
- Establish "zaiq-compatible" as a standard for development methodologies

### 3. Create Sustainable Network Effects Through Capacity Sharing
**Objective:** Build a platform where value increases exponentially with user adoption.

**Network Effect Metrics:**
- Average team productivity increases 2x when team size doubles
- Community capacity pools reduce individual wait times by 85%
- Cross-team collaboration increases 3x through shared resources
