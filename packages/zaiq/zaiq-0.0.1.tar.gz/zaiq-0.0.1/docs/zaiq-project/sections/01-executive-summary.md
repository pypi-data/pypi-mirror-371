# Executive Summary

## zaiq

**Product Concept:** A Docker-deployable service that automates software development tasks by distributing BMAD-structured stories to remote AI coding instances, managing dependencies through DAG visualization, and eventually enabling time-block sharing between team members.

**Primary Problem Being Solved:** Development teams face artificial productivity constraints from AI usage limits (rate limits, quotas, usage caps) despite having well-defined work that could be automated. This creates a bottleneck where developers have clear tasks ready but must wait for their usage window to reset.

**Target Market:** 
- **Primary:** Individual developers using AI coding assistants who need to maximize their AI-assisted development capacity
- **Secondary:** Small development teams (2-10 developers) looking to pool and optimize their collective Claude usage
- **Future:** Mid-size organizations wanting to standardize AI-assisted development workflows

**Key Value Proposition:** Transform idle AI time blocks into productive development capacity through intelligent task distribution and dependency management, effectively multiplying your team's AI-assisted development throughput without additional subscriptions.

## Why This Matters Now

1. **AI Usage Constraints:** Rate limits, quotas, and usage caps create real productivity gaps
2. **BMAD Maturity:** The BMAD methodology provides structured story format ready for automation
3. **Remote Work Reality:** Distributed teams need better async development coordination
4. **AI Development Adoption:** More teams are integrating AI assistants into their workflow

## Unique Differentiators

- **Time-Block Marketplace:** Unlike traditional CI/CD, zaiq enables sharing unused capacity
- **BMAD Native:** Built specifically for BMAD/Agile story structures
- **DAG Dependency Management:** Visual story dependency tracking
- **AI-Optimized:** Designed specifically for AI coding capabilities and constraints

## Strategic Considerations

### Build vs Buy Decision
- **Build:** No existing solution addresses AI-specific constraints with BMAD integration
- **Buy Alternative:** Could extend existing CI/CD tools but would lose Claude optimization

### Naming Rationale
- "zaiq" is memorable and searchable with AI-agnostic positioning
- Avoids generic terms that compete with established tools

### Success Metrics Preview
- Reduction in AI idle time from 80% to 20%
- Story completion rate increase of 3x
- Developer satisfaction score > 4.5/5

## Notes & Decisions

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Docker deployment for maximum portability
- Git-native to work with existing workflows
- DAG visualization as core feature, not add-on
- Security-first approach for SSH key management

**Trade-offs Considered:**
- Complexity vs Usability: Starting simple with single-user mode
- Speed vs Safety: Prioritizing secure key handling over quick setup
- Feature-rich vs Focused: MVP focuses on core orchestration, not analytics

**Questions for Further Discussion:**
- Should we support multiple AI service accounts from day one?
- How much story preprocessing should be automated?
- What level of customization should be exposed to users?
