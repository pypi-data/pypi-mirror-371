# Workflow

Workflow is a Python-based system designed to manage and automate any task in a structured manner. It provides a framework for defining (work), scheduling (buckets), sequencing (pipelines), executing (managers) and archiving (results) the output of any task. The system is designed to be modular with a low threshold of entry for new users, while also providing advanced features for power users.
