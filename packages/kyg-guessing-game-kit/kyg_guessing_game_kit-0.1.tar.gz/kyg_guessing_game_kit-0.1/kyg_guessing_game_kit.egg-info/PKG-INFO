# Co-Kreate Your Genius: KYG Guessing Game Kit

An interactive, gamified toolkit for learning Python fundamentals—built on a proven method by [Ashok Bakthavathsalam](https://www.ashokbakthavathsalam.com/) and created by [Sathish Ramanujam](https://professor-sathish.github.io/).

## What is KYG Guessing Game Kit?

This is a fun, hands-on way for students to experience Python’s five core constructs—**print statements, function calls, variable input, import, GUI basics**—in a real game.

* Designed for “Zero2Hero” Python induction events.
* Lets students play the classic “guess my number!” challenge.
* All logic shown in code—and explained interactively through gameplay.
* Perfect for classroom, online exercises, coding clubs, or self-learning.

## Why Use This Kit?

* Developed by Python educators for rapid onboarding and retention.
* Play, explore, then dive into code: students see the GUI first, then relate it to Python logic.
* Each step introduces a core Python concept in context.

## How to Play

* Open the game GUI, let students choose a range, and let the computer try to guess.
* Students respond with HIGHER/LOWER/YES buttons as the computer guesses their number.
* Behind the scenes: binary and linear search strategies are explained in code and gameplay.
* Replay as needed, experiment, and learn.
