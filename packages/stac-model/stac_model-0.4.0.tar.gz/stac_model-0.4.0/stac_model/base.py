    Allows wrapping any field with an annotation to drop it entirely if unset.

    ```python
    field: Annotated[Optional[<desiredType>], OmitIfNone] = None
    # or
    field: Annotated[Optional[<desiredType>], OmitIfNone] = Field(default=None)
    ```

    Since `OmitIfNone` implies that the value could be `None` (even though it would be dropped),
    the `Optional` annotation must be specified to corresponding typings to avoid `mypy` lint issues.

    It is important to use `MLMBaseModel`, otherwise the serializer will not be called and applied.
