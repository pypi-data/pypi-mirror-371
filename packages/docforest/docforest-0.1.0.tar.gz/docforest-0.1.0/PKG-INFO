# DocForest

**DocForest** is a Python library for intelligently chunking structured documents like Markdown and AsciiDoc. It organizes document content into a recursive, tree-like structure, ensuring that each chunk retains its full contextual path from its parent headings. This makes it an ideal tool for RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems, semantic search, and other NLP tasks.

### Features

  * **Hierarchical Chunking**: Splits documents based on heading levels, preserving the logical structure.
  * **Context Preservation**: Each section's content is linked to all its parent headings, providing rich context.
  * **Flexible Output**: Generates a structured "forest" or "tree" that is easy to traverse and process.
  * **Support for Multiple Formats**: Built to handle various structured document types.

### Installation

Install `docforest` from PyPI:

```bash
pip install docforest
```

### Usage

```python
# (Code examples will be added here once the core logic is implemented.)
