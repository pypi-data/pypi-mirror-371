    - Submit the PR.

## üìè Coding Style

This project uses `Ruff` for linting and `Black` (via Ruff's `E501` ignore and `pre-commit` hook) for code formatting.

- **Ruff**: We use `ruff` to enforce code quality and style. Please run it before committing.
- **Black**: Files are formatted with `Black`. `pre-commit` hooks are configured to run `Black` automatically.

To ensure your code adheres to the style, we recommend setting up [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/):

```bash
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

This will automatically run `ruff` (and `Black` implicitly) and other checks before you commit.

## üß™ Testing

- All new features and bug fixes should be accompanied by appropriate unit or integration tests.
- Tests are written using `pytest`.
- Run tests using the provided script: `./scripts/test.sh`. This also generates a coverage report.
