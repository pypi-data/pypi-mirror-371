``RATANSunPy`` 

RATANSunPy is a Python package developed for accessing, visualizing, and analyzing
multi-band radio observations of the Sun from the RATAN-600 complex. These data are 
valuable for diagnosing solar plasma conditions and predicting solar activity. 
However, working with these data requires extensive processing and a thorough 
understanding of the RATAN-600 system. The package offers comprehensive data 
processing functionalities, including direct access to raw data, essential 
processing steps such as calibration and quiet Sun normalization, and tools for 
analyzing solar activity. This includes automatic detection of local sources,
identifying them with NOAA active regions, and further determining parameters for 
local sources and active regions.
