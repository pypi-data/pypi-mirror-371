Tensor Container provides efficient, type-safe tensor container implementations for PyTorch workflows. It includes PyTree integration and torch.compile optimization for batched tensor operations.

The library includes tensor containers, probabilistic distributions, and batch/event dimension semantics for machine learning workflows.

## What is TensorContainer?

TensorContainer transforms how you work with structured tensor data in PyTorch by providing **tensor-like operations for entire data structures**. Instead of manually managing individual tensors across devices, batch dimensions, and nested hierarchies, TensorContainer lets you treat complex data as unified entities that behave just like regular tensors.

### 🚀 **Unified Operations Across Data Types**

Apply tensor operations like `view()`, `permute()`, `detach()`, and device transfers to entire data structures—no matter how complex:

```python
# Single operation transforms entire distribution
distribution = distribution.view(2, 3, 4).permute(1, 0, 2).detach()

# Works seamlessly across TensorDict, TensorDataClass, and TensorDistribution
data = data.to('cuda').reshape(batch_size, -1).clone()
```

### 🔄 **Drop-in Compatibility with PyTorch**

TensorContainer integrates seamlessly with existing PyTorch workflows:
- **torch.distributions compatibility**: TensorDistribution is API-compatible with `torch.distributions` while adding tensor-like operations
- **PyTree support**: All containers work with `torch.utils._pytree` operations and `torch.compile`
- **Zero learning curve**: If you know PyTorch tensors, you already know TensorContainer

### ⚡ **Eliminates Boilerplate Code**

Compare the complexity difference:

**With torch.distributions** (manual parameter handling):
```python
# Requires type-specific parameter extraction and reconstruction
if isinstance(dist, Normal):
    detached = Normal(loc=dist.loc.detach(), scale=dist.scale.detach())
elif isinstance(dist, Categorical):
    detached = Categorical(logits=dist.logits.detach())
# ... more type checks needed
```

**With TensorDistribution** (unified interface):
```python
# Works for any distribution type
detached = dist.detach()
```

### 🏗️ **Structured Data Made Simple**

Handle complex, nested tensor structures with the same ease as single tensors:
- **Batch semantics**: Consistent shape handling across all nested tensors
- **Device management**: Move entire structures between CPU/GPU with single operations
- **Shape validation**: Automatic verification of tensor compatibility
- **Type safety**: Full IDE support with static typing and autocomplete

TensorContainer doesn't just store your data—it makes working with structured tensors as intuitive as working with individual tensors, while maintaining full compatibility with the PyTorch ecosystem you already know.

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/mctigger/tensor-container.git
cd tensor-container

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .

# Install with development dependencies
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.9+
- PyTorch 2.0+

## Quick Start

### TensorDict: Dictionary-Style Containers

```python
import torch
from tensorcontainer import TensorDict

# Create a TensorDict with batch semantics
data = TensorDict({
    'observations': torch.randn(32, 128),
    'actions': torch.randn(32, 4),
    'rewards': torch.randn(32, 1)
}, shape=(32,), device='cpu')

# Dictionary-like access
obs = data['observations']
data['new_field'] = torch.zeros(32, 10)

# Batch operations work seamlessly
stacked_data = torch.stack([data, data])  # Shape: (2, 32)
```

### TensorDataClass: Type-Safe Containers

```python
import torch
from tensorcontainer import TensorDataClass

class RLData(TensorDataClass):
    observations: torch.Tensor
    actions: torch.Tensor
    rewards: torch.Tensor

# Create with full type safety and IDE support
data = RLData(
    observations=torch.randn(32, 128),
    actions=torch.randn(32, 4),
    rewards=torch.randn(32, 1),
    shape=(32,),
    device='cpu'
)

# Type-safe field access with autocomplete
obs = data.observations
data.actions = torch.randn(32, 8)  # Type-checked assignment
```

### TensorDistribution: Probabilistic Containers

```python
import torch
from tensorcontainer import TensorDistribution

# Built-in distribution types
from tensorcontainer.tensor_distribution import (
    TensorNormal, TensorBernoulli, TensorCategorical,
    TensorTruncatedNormal, TensorTanhNormal
)

# Create probabilistic tensor containers
normal_dist = TensorNormal(
    loc=torch.zeros(32, 4),
    scale=torch.ones(32, 4),
    shape=(32,),
    device='cpu'
)

# Sample and compute probabilities
samples = normal_dist.sample()  # Shape: (32, 4)
log_probs = normal_dist.log_prob(samples)
entropy = normal_dist.entropy()

# Categorical distributions for discrete actions
categorical = TensorCategorical(
    logits=torch.randn(32, 6),  # 6 possible actions
    shape=(32,),
    device='cpu'
)
```

### PyTree Operations

```python
# All containers work seamlessly with PyTree operations
import torch.utils._pytree as pytree

# Transform all tensors in the container
doubled_data = pytree.tree_map(lambda x: x * 2, data)

# Combine multiple containers
combined = pytree.tree_map(lambda x, y: x + y, data1, data2)
```

## API Overview

### Core Components

- **`TensorContainer`**: Base class providing core tensor manipulation operations with batch/event dimension semantics
- **`TensorDict`**: Dictionary-like container for dynamic tensor collections with nested structure support
- **`TensorDataClass`**: DataClass-based container for static, typed tensor structures
- **`TensorDistribution`**: Distribution wrapper for probabilistic tensor operations

### Key Concepts

- **Batch Dimensions**: Leading dimensions defined by the `shape` parameter, consistent across all tensors
- **Event Dimensions**: Trailing dimensions beyond batch shape, can vary per tensor
- **PyTree Integration**: All containers are registered PyTree nodes for seamless tree operations
- **Device Consistency**: Automatic validation ensures all tensors reside on compatible devices
- **Unsafe Construction**: Context manager for performance-critical scenarios with validation bypass

## torch.compile Compatibility

Tensor Container is designed for `torch.compile` compatibility:

```python
@torch.compile
def process_batch(data: TensorDict) -> TensorDict:
    # PyTree operations compile efficiently
    return TensorContainer._tree_map(lambda x: torch.relu(x), data)

@torch.compile
def sample_and_score(dist: TensorNormal, actions: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    # Distribution operations are compile-safe
    return dist.log_prob(actions)

# All operations compile efficiently with minimal graph breaks
compiled_result = process_batch(tensor_dict)
log_probs = sample_and_score(normal_dist, action_tensor)
```

The testing framework includes compile compatibility verification to ensure operations work efficiently under JIT compilation, including:
- Graph break detection and minimization
- Recompilation tracking
- Memory leak prevention
- Performance benchmarking
