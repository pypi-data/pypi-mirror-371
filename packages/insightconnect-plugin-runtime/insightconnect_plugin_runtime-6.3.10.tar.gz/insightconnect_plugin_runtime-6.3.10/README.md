The InsightConnect Python Plugin Runtime is used for building plugins in Python for Rapid7 InsightConnect. The project
results in the building and publishing of two components: 

* Python Plugin Runtime Library 
* Base InsightConnect Plugin Docker Images 

![InsightConnect Python Plugin Runtime Diagram](plugin-runtime-diagram.png)

Docker images created during the build and deployment of this project are uploaded to the 
[Rapid7 Docker Repositories](https://hub.docker.com/orgs/rapid7/repositories).

Further [documentation](https://komand.github.io/python/start.html) for building an InsightConnect plugin is available 
to get started.

## Development of the InsightConnect Plugin Runtime

The Python Runtime codebase is built to support Python 3.11.13 as of version 6.2.3. The following dependencies will need 
to be installed when developing or testing the Plugin Runtime:

- Python 3.11.13
- Docker
- make
- tox

### Getting Started

#### Building Python Library

To build and install the plugin runtime library locally, first create a Python virtual environment for the particular Python 
version and activate it. Then build, install, and confirm the package has been installed.
```
> python3 -m venv venv
> source venv/bin/activate
> pip install -e ./
> pip list | grep insightconnect-plugin-runtime
insightconnect-plugin-runtime 6.2.3
```

#### Building the InsightConnect Plugin Runtime Docker Images

Currently the `python-3` dockerfile is used by default when building the docker image. If you want to specify another
dockerfile for testing purposes, such as `python-3-slim`, you can pass it as an argument.

```
make build-image DOCKERFILE=python-3-slim
```

This will overwrite the default `python-3`, provided that it exists in the `dockerfiles` directory.

#### Building/troubleshooting local images (Mac M1)

Our images are built with OS/ARCH:linux/amd64 due to our ci.yml file specifying linux. Historically this has
not caused any issues but with an M1 Mac, docker will now use arm64. This is because docker builds the image to match the
distribution of the OS running the command. To ensure that building locally and on GH produces an image of the same 
architecture the `--platform` specifier is passed in the dockerfile.

If you build a plugin locally we can see further issues that:
- the local image does match the current OS distro so docker continues to look remotely..
- docker can not find this (newly created) image remotely on docker registry (dev images should not be pushed to registry)

To overcome this we need to specify `platform=linux/amd64` in the plugin docker file. E.g. if building plugins/html then
this file should be updated `plugins/html/Dockerfile`.
*Note*: building this arch on mac M1 will cause the build to be slower.


Example error of local image not matching OS distro without passing the `--platform` flag:
```
 => ERROR [internal] load metadata for docker.io/rapid7/insightconnect-python-3-slim-plugin:latest                          1.4s

--------------------

make: *** [image] Error 1
```

### Testing Sample Plugin
The easiest way to test changes to the runtime is by running it locally against one of the [sample plugins](./samples) 
included in the repository. Make sure a virtual environment has been activated and then pass in the sample directory 
name as a parameter:
```
> make sample=example run-sample
```

The plugin will be started in `http` mode and listening at `http:0.0.0.0:10001`:
```
[2020-02-13 23:21:13 -0500] [56567] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 23.0.0
[2020-02-13 23:21:13 -0500] [56567] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:10001 (56567)
[2020-02-13 23:21:13 -0500] [56567] [INFO] Using worker: threads
[2020-02-13 23:21:13 -0500] [56571] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 56571
```

To override Gunicorn config export environment variable GUNICORN_CONFIG_FILE pointing to json file with config
See example in samples/example/gcfg.json 
```
export GUNICORN_CONFIG_FILE ="./gcfg.json"
```

To build, install, and run runtime changes without the use of the `run-sample` rule, the below steps can be used for 
same result:
```
> python setup.py build && python setup.py install
> cd samples/example
> python setup.py build && python setup.py install
> ./bin/icon_example http
```

### Testing Locally with Docker Runtime

In addition to testing locally with the resulting runtime and an InsightConnect plugin, it is also possible to build a 
plugin locally and test it as it would be used by the InsightConnect orchestrator.

First, build the base runtime:
```
make build-image
```

This will result in tagged Docker images that can be used in the included sample plugins. Then the plugin can be built 
and run locally:
```
> cd samples/example
> icon-plugin build image --no-pull
> docker run -it -p 10001:10001 rapid7/example:latest http
```

## Running Tests

In order to run tests, first ensure `tox` has been installed. Tox makes it easy for testing this project in isolated 
virtual environments and for specific Python versions. To install tox:
```
> pip install tox
```

Running all tests:
```
> tox
```

Running a specific test file:
```
> tox -e py39 -- tests/plugin/hello_world/tests/test_cli.py
```

## Plugin vs Slim Plugin Comparison

|                   | Plugin  | Slim Plugin |
|:------------------|:-------:|:-----------:|
| Python Version    | 3.11.13 |   3.11.13   |
| OS                | Alpine  |  Bullseye   |
| Package installer |   apk   |     apt     |
| Shell             | /bin/sh |  /bin/bash  |
| Image Size        | ~370MB  |   ~230MB    |

Note that for the plugin image, we run `apk update` and `apk add ..` which leads to a longer build time.

## Release

To release a new version of the InsightConnect Python Plugin Runtime, the below steps must be followed:

1. Make sure that version is updated in changelog, and `setup.py` file. 
2. Create a Pull Request with your changes to be merged into master
3. Merge changes after receiving at least one approval
4. Create a versioned tag off of release; version must follow [SemVer](https://semver.org/); using the `git tag [version #]` command (not through the GitHub release UI!) then `git push origin --tags`.
5. [Github Action](https://github.com/rapid7/komand-plugin-sdk-python/actions) will perform a matrix build and release 
based on the recently created tag for each Python version and Dockerfile in scope

## Contributions

Contributions for maintaining and enhancing the InsightConnect Python Plugin Runtime are appreciated. This project uses
[Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting and includes a pre-commit hook to auto format code as it is
contributed. Black is installed as a test dependency and the hook can be initialized by running `pre-commit install` 
after cloning this repository.
