class StabilizeTask:
    """
    Utility class that sets an oven's setpoint and waits for the temperature to stabilize.

    Parameters
    ----------
    oven
        The oven to use. It must already be connected.
    measurement_interval_ms
        The measurement interval in milliseconds.
    minimum_measurements
        The minimum number of within-**tolerance** measurements that need to be taken for the
        temperature to be "stable".
    tolerance
        How far off the temperature can be from the setpoint before the measurement is considered
        "unstable".
    step
        The step calling this function.
    runner
        The `StepRunner` running **step**.
    data_directory
        Where the step is recording data.
    temperature_filename
        The name of the file to record the temperatures to.

    Notes
    -----
    - The **oven** must already be connected, and the caller is responsible for disconnecting it.
    - This class will ensure the **setpoint** is within the oven's allowed range and will prompt
    the user if the setpoint is invalid.
