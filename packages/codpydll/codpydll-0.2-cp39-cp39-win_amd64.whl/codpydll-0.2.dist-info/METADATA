# Purposes 

This library is a tool for the [codpy](https://pypi.org/project/codpy/) project.

# Installation 

Note: this installation process has been tested on
 * windows / amd64 platform 

## prerequisite

### Minimum installation

* [python3.9.7](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.9.7/python-3.9.7-amd64.exe): a valid python python3.9.7 installation.

*NOTE* : Python installation differs from one machine to another. The python root folder is denoted "\<path/to/python39>" in the rest of this document. The software Everything (or another equivalent) can be of great help finding files.

## Installation

### prerequisite

We suppose that there is a valid python installation on the host machine. The reader can 
* either use its main python environment ```<path/to/python39>```
* or create a virtual python environment ```<path/to/venv>```, a good practice that we describe in the rest of this section.

First open a command shell ```cmd```,  create a virtual environment and activate it.

```
python -m venv .\venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```
*NOTE* : In the rest of the installation procedure, we consider a virtual environment <path/to/venv>. One can replace with <path/to/python39> if a main environment installation is desired, for dev purposes for instance.

### pip install codpydll

Open a command shell ```cmd```, and pip install codpy

```
pip install codpydll
```
The installation procedure might take some minutes depending on your internet connection.

### Test codpydll

open a python shell and import codpydll
```
python
```
```
import codpydll
```
