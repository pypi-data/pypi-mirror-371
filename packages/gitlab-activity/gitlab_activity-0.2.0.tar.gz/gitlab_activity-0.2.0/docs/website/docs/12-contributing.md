# Contributing to GitLab Activity

If you're reading this section, you're probably interested in contributing to
`gitlab-activity`. Welcome and thanks for your interest in contributing. There are many
ways to contribute to the project.

## Contribution types

### Bug reports

Bug reports are an important type of contribution - it's important to get feedback
about how the tool is failing, and there's no better way to do that than to hear
about real-life failure cases. A good bug report will include:

- A minimal, reproducible example - a small, self-contained script that can reproduce
  the behavior is the best way to get your bug fixed. For more information and tips on
  how to structure these, read
  [Stack Overflow's guide to creating a minimal, complete, verified example](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve).

- The platform and versions of everything involved, at a minimum please include
  operating system, python version and `gitlab-activity` version.
  Instructions on getting your versions:

      - `gitlab-activity`: `python -c "import gitlab-activity; print(gitlab-activity.__version__)"`
      - Python: `python --version`

- A description of the problem - what is happening and what should happen.

While pull requests fixing bugs are accepted, they are not required - the bug report
in itself is a great contribution.

### Feature requests

If you would like to see a new feature in `gitlab-activity`, it is probably best to
start an issue for discussion rather than taking the time to implement a feature
which may or may not be appropriate for `gitlab-activity`. For minor features
(ones where you don't have to put a lot of effort into the MR), a pull request
is fine but still not necessary.

### Merge requests

If you would like to fix something in `gitlab-activity` - improvements to documentation,
bug fixes, feature implementations, fixes to the build system, etc - merge requests
are welcome! Where possible, try to keep your coding to PEP 8 style. `pre-commit` can
be used to stay within styling guides.

The most important thing to include in your merge request are tests - please write
one or more tests to cover the behavior you intend your patch to improve.

## Development Setup

### Using a virtual environment

It is advisable to work in a virtual environment for development of `gitlab-activity`.
This can be done using [virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/):

```
python -m virtualenv .venv      # Create virtual environment in .venv directory
source .venv/bin/activate       # Activate the virtual environment
```

Alternatively you can create a
[conda environment](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html):

```
conda create -n gitlab-activity                # Create a conda environment
# conda create -n gitlab-activity python=3.8   # Or specify a version
conda activate gitlab-activity                 # Activate the conda environment
```

Once your virtual environment is created, install the library in development mode:

```
pip install -e '.[dev]'
```

This will install all the package dependencies including the ones required for
development.

### pre-commit

The package uses [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run styling packages like
`black`, `ruff`, _etc._. First install `pre-commit` components to setup the development
environment

```
pre-commit install
```

After this step, `pre-commit` will run at every git commit and reformats the files
according to styling config provided in the `pyproject.toml`. If user wishes to run
`pre-commit` manually, it can be done using

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Tests

Tests can be run in the current environment using `pytest` command

```
pytest
```

In order to test multiple Python versions, we can use
[hatch environments](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/environment/) which are analogous
to tools `tox` and `nox`. Unlike the stated tools, `hatch` can create a Python
installation without having to dependent on existing Python versions on the
local machine.

In order to use `hatch` environments, first the user need to install `hatch` in
the current environment

```
pip install 'hatch>1.7.0'
```

:::note

It is important to install `hatch>1.7.0` as the feature that creates the different
versions of Python environments has been added after `1.7.0`. See related
[PR](https://github.com/pypa/hatch/pull/1002).

:::

Once `hatch` is installed, users can run test in a given Python environment using

```
hatch run +py=3.11 test:test
```

This command will do following:

- Create a Python environment with Python 3.11
- Install project and its dependencies in development mode
- Invoke `pytest` command and executes all the tests

If user wishes to test all Python versions that the package supports, they can do
it with single command

```
hatch run test:test
```

If users want to run the tests with all the supported Python versions _modulo_
Python 3.8, it can be done using

```
hatch run -py=3.8 test:test
```

To list all the supported environments of current package, we can use

```
hatch env show --ascii
```

which will list the names of supported environments and their variants.

## Documentation

This project uses a mix of [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) and
[Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/) to generate documentation. The main
documentation is made with Docusaurus and API docs are generated by Sphinx. In addition
a customized script based on [`md-click`](https://github.com/RiveryIO/md-click/tree/main)
project is used to generate documentation for CLI options.

All different steps of documentation are consolidated into different scripts and
hatch environments are used to be able to generate documentation easily. Users need
to execute the following command to build documentation of Docusaurus, Sphinx and CLI
options

```
hatch run docs:build
```

Once the build process finishes, the users can serve the documentation using command

```
hatch run docs:serve
```

In order to make changes to docusaurus and see the changes in real time, use the command

```
hatch run docs:start
```

This will open the documentation in your browser and when you make changes to the
sources od docusaurus, they will appear in real time in the browser. However, if users
make changes in Sphinx or CLI options docs, they need to either rebuild or restart the
docs to see those changes.
