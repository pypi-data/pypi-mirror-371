# Configuration

This folder contains example config files that can be used to configure
`gitlab-activity`. Using CLI arguments is a cumbersome task, and thus,
`gitlab-activity` supports configuring all the CLI options using a config file.

Currently, `gitlab-activity` supports three different files based on the type of
target project. `gitlab-activity` will check for the following files in the current
working directory in the order of priority to load the configuration.

- `.gitlab-activity.toml`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `package.json`

:::note

If, for example, both `.gitlab-activity.toml` and `pyproject.toml` are found to
have valid configuration, only configuration from `.gitlab-activity.toml` file
will be loaded and used due to its higher priority.

:::

## Configuration using `.gitlab-activity.toml`

An example [configuration file](https://gitlab.com/mahendrapaipuri/gitlab-activity/-/blob/main/example-configs/.gitlab-activity.toml)
can be found in the repository. Globally, this
TOML file has two sections namely, `options` and `activity`.

:::tip

If the file `.gitlab-activity.toml` exists in the directory where the
`gitlab-activity` CLI command will be invoked, it will automatically loaded. If it is
placed elsewhere, users need to pass the path of config file using `--config` CLI option.

:::

All CLI options can be configured within `options` section and repository specific
metadata like the labels used by Issues and MRs, bot users used within the repository
can be configured within `activity` section. Within the `activity` section, users can
define list of bot users under variable `bot_users`. For example, it can be defined as follows:

```
[activity]

bot_users = [
  "gitlab-bot",
  "ghost1",
  "codecov-bot",
]
```

Using such a config, all these users will be excluded in
the generated report in the contributors list.

You may want to completely omit some issues or merge requests with specific labels from the changelog.
Specify such labels under `exclude_labels`:

```
[activity]

exclude_labels = [
  "skip-changelog",
]
```

Items carrying any of these labels will be removed from the changelog and won't
be counted in the contributors list.

`activity` section has another subsection called `activity.categories` which should be
used to define the labels used for the repository. An excerpt is as follows:

```
[activity.categories]
# Dicts must be inline for linters not to complain
issues = [
  { labels = [ "feature", "feat", "new" ], pre = [ "NEW", "FEAT", "FEATURE" ], description = "New features added" },
  { labels = [ "enhancement", "enhancements" ], pre = [ "ENH", "ENHANCEMENT", "IMPROVE", "IMP" ], description = "Enhancements made" },
  { labels = [ "bug", "bugfix", "bugs" ], pre = [ "FIX", "BUG" ], description = "Bugs fixed" },
  { labels = [ "maintenance", "maint" ], pre = [ "MAINT", "MNT" ], description = "Maintenance and upkeep improvements" },
  { labels = [ "documentation", "docs", "doc" ], pre = [ "DOC", "DOCS" ], description = "Documentation improvements" },
  { labels = [ "deprecation", "deprecate" ], pre = [ "DEPRECATE", "DEPRECATION", "DEP" ], description = "Deprecated features" },
]
# Dicts must be inline for linters not to complain
mrs = [
  { labels = [ "feature", "feat", "new" ], pre = [ "NEW", "FEAT", "FEATURE" ], description = "New features added" },
  { labels = [ "enhancement", "enhancements" ], pre = [ "ENH", "ENHANCEMENT", "IMPROVE", "IMP" ], description = "Enhancements made" },
  { labels = [ "bug", "bugfix", "bugs" ], pre = [ "FIX", "BUG" ], description = "Bugs fixed" },
  { labels = [ "maintenance", "maint" ], pre = [ "MAINT", "MNT" ], description = "Maintenance and upkeep improvements" },
  { labels = [ "documentation", "docs", "doc" ], pre = [ "DOC", "DOCS" ], description = "Documentation improvements" },
  { labels = [ "deprecation", "deprecate" ], pre = [ "DEPRECATE", "DEPRECATION", "DEP" ], description = "Deprecated features" },
]
```

The categories of either `issues` or `merge_requests` should be a list of dicts. Each
dict should have three keys namely:

- `labels`: List of labels the project uses to categorize in issues/MRs
- `pre`: List of prefixes used in the titles of issues/MRs
- `description`: Description that must be emitted in the generated activity report/Changelog

Users can define the categories of labels for issues and MRs separately. This gives
more flexibility to properly categorize the activity in changelogs. If a project uses
same labels for both issues and MRs, users can define just one of
`activity.categories.issues` or `activity.categories.merge_requests`, and the tool
will use the same categories for the other one. This avoids duplicating config.

## Configuration using `pyproject.toml`

Configuration using `pyproject.toml` follows exactly the same pattern as the
configuration through `.gitlab-activity.toml`, albeit, the configuration should go
under section `[tool.gitlab-activity]`. An example [config file](https://gitlab.com/mahendrapaipuri/gitlab-activity/-/blob/main/example-configs/pyproject.toml)
is provided in the repository. This is very convienet for Python based projects where
the configuration can be included in the packages main `pyproject.toml` and avoid
having separate configuration file.

## Configuration using `package.json`

Configuration using `package.json` should go under the key `gitlab-activity`. It
follows same schema as `.gitlab-acivity.toml`, albeit, in JSON format.
A [schema](https://gitlab.com/mahendrapaipuri/gitlab-activity/-/blob/main/gitlab_activity/schema.json)
is available in the repository which will be used to validate the config file. Projects
based on `node` can use this file to include the `gitlab-activity` config.

# Which file should I use?

It depends on the type of project. If your project is based on Python we recommend using
`pyproject.toml` or if your project is based on `node`, we recommend using `package.json`.
If your project is based on other frameworks, you can use `.gitlab-activity.toml` and
place it in the root of the repository.
