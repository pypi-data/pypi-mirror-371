# GCSOPT

Python library based on [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org) to solve optimization problems in Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS).
For a detailed description of the algorithms implemented implemented in this library see the PhD thesis [Graphs of Convex Sets with Applications to Optimal Control and Motion Planning
](https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/156598?show=full).

## Main features

- Uses the syntax of [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org) for describing convex sets and convex functions
- Provides a simple intefact for assemblying your graphs
- Interface with state-of-the-art solvers via [CVXPY](https://www.cvxpy.org/)  

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

You can install the latest release from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/gcsopt/):

```bash
pip install gcsopt
