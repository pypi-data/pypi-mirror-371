"""Model weights management for CulicidaeLab predictors.

This module defines the ModelWeightsManager, a class responsible for ensuring
that the necessary model weight files are available locally. If the weights
are not present, it coordinates with a provider service (e.g., HuggingFace)
to download them.

Attributes:
    settings (Settings): The main settings object for the library.
    provider_service (ProviderService): The service used to access and
        download model weights from various providers.
