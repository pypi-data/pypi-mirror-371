This is my game that I submitted for Terminal-craft(A YSWS programme for Summer of Making). Its a simple python game about a guy trying to save his European village from a German tribe.It is still in the starting phase I'm planning to add some new features in the upcoming feature.  The idea was inspired by  simple game that I made a few months back while learning python . Its a CLI game that kind of relates to Germans so I put the name terminal spiel because ' spiel' means game in German and..It kinda sounds cool.
