    A Signal is an ordered sequence of (value, ts_ns) where timestamps are
    strictly increasing. The value at time t is defined as the last value at
    or before t; the signal is undefined for t < first_timestamp.

    Access patterns:
    - Index-based: integer/slice/array indexing by position. Slices and arrays
      return Signal views; implementations aim to share storage when possible.
    - Time-based: `signal.time[...]` provides timestamp access (snapshots,
      windows, stepped sampling). Stepped time sampling materializes the
      requested timestamps.

    Concrete implementations decide storage/layout (e.g., Parquet for
    scalar/vector, encoded video + Parquet index for images) but must follow
    the semantics above.
