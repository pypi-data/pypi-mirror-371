# NOTE:
# Tool usage is not universally supported across all free model endpoints on OpenRouter.
# If a selected model does not support tools, any attempt to call them will result
# in routing errors or failed requests.
#
# To ensure smooth execution when using free endpoints, disable tools in your agent
# configuration by setting:
# 
#   tools: []
#
# Paid OpenRouter accounts generally provide access to models that support tools,
# but if you are on a free plan, always verify the modelâ€™s capabilities before
# enabling tool calls.
