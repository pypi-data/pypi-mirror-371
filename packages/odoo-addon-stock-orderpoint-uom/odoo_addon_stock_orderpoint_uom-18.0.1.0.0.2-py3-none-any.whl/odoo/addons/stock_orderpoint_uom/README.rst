This module allows users users to define what unit of measure should be
used in procurements created from minimum stock rules.

A typical use case would be a product that is stocked in centimeters,
and needs to be restocked in meters from another warehouse. When the
picking is created, the quantity to be transferred will be expressed in
meters, making it easier for the people responsible for the transfers to
understand the requirement.
