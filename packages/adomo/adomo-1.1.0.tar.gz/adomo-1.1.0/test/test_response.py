CxO Bot Automation API

 CxO Bot Automation API manages the CxO automation platform.  ## Workflows  A CxO Workflow defines the overall flow of AI automated tasks.  Conceptually, a Workflow is a sequence of steps. Those steps are defined by advanced AI units, known as Agents, and are carried out by performing detailed actions, resulting in a execution run.  ## Schedules  CxO Schedules are features allowing you to execute specific CxO Workflows at specified times or intervals.
