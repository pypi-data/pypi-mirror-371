# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
TunaCode was created to provide developers with a powerful command-line interface for code analysis and manipulation tasks. As the codebase grew, several large Python files became difficult to maintain and understand, leading to the current refactoring initiative.

The project exists to:
- Provide a robust CLI tool for code analysis
- Enable efficient code manipulation and refactoring
- Support developers in maintaining large codebases
- Demonstrate best practices in Python development

## Problems It Solves
1. **Code Maintainability**: Large Python files (>500 lines) are difficult to navigate, understand, and modify
2. **Developer Productivity**: Complex code structures slow down development and increase the likelihood of bugs
3. **Code Quality**: Large files often contain hidden complexity and interdependencies that are hard to manage
4. **Onboarding Challenges**: New developers struggle to understand large, monolithic code files
5. **Testing Difficulties**: Large files are harder to test comprehensively and isolate for characterization testing

## How It Should Work
TunaCode should provide a seamless command-line experience for code analysis tasks:
- Intuitive command structure with clear, predictable behavior
- Fast execution with minimal resource overhead
- Comprehensive error handling with helpful diagnostic messages
- Consistent output formatting across all commands
- Extensible architecture that supports new features and tools

The refactored codebase should:
- Be organized into small, focused modules (under 500 lines each)
- Follow modern Python best practices and idioms
- Maintain full backward compatibility with existing APIs
- Provide clear separation of concerns between components
- Include comprehensive documentation for all public interfaces

## User Experience Goals
1. **Reliability**: Users should be able to trust that TunaCode behaves consistently and predictably
2. **Performance**: Commands should execute quickly with minimal resource consumption
3. **Clarity**: Error messages and output should be clear and actionable
4. **Discoverability**: Commands and options should be easy to find and understand
5. **Extensibility**: The tool should be easy to extend with new functionality
6. **Maintainability**: The codebase should be easy for developers to understand and modify

## Target User Base
- Software developers working with Python codebases
- DevOps engineers performing code analysis tasks
- Technical leads responsible for code quality
- Open source contributors to the TunaCode project

## Value Proposition
TunaCode provides developers with a powerful, reliable tool for code analysis and manipulation while maintaining a codebase that exemplifies modern Python best practices. The refactoring effort ensures that both the tool and its implementation remain valuable to users and maintainers alike.
