# Task 16: Create error synthesis system for user-friendly error messages
_Started: 2025-07-29 14:59:29_
_Agent: main

[1] ## Analysis: Current Retry Mechanism
[1]
[1] 1. Found max_retries configuration in get_or_create_agent() - lines 502-569
[1] 2. Retry tracking in track_tool_retry() - lines 668-681
[1] 3. When retries exhausted, generic message: Tool execution failed after {max_retries} retry attempts
[1] 4. Missing: User-friendly error synthesis based on exception type
[2] ## Design: synthesize_error_response() Function
[2]
[2] ### Location: src/tunacode/core/agents/main.py
[2]
[2] ### Function Signature:
[2]
[2]
[2] ### Key Integration Points:
[2] 1. Line 626: Replace generic Tool execution failed after X retry attempts
[2] 2. patch_tool_messages() calls - enhance error messages
[2] 3. Handle different exception types with specific templates
[3] ## Integration Points Found:
[3]
[3] 1. Line 626: Generic retry exhaustion message
[3] 2. execute_with_error_handling() - Line 120-125: Catches exceptions but returns them
[3] 3. Need to store exception info for later synthesis
[3] 4. patch_tool_messages() function - handles error patching
[4] ## Challenge: Exception capture location
[4]
[4] The bug report shows exceptions are swallowed in execute_with_error_handling.
[4] Need different approach:
[4] 1. Store exceptions when ModelRetry is raised in tools
[4] 2. Use tool_call_id from retry-prompt part
[4] 3. Access stored exception in patch_tool_messages
[5] ## Implementation Summary
[5]
[5] Successfully implemented error synthesis system for Task 16:
[5]
[5] 1. Created synthesize_error_response() function in main.py
[5]    - Handles FileNotFoundError, PermissionError, IsADirectoryError
[5]    - Handles OSError (disk space), UnicodeDecodeError, TimeoutError
[5]    - Provides actionable suggestions for each error type
[5]    - Includes retry count information
[5]
[5] 2. Integration with retry mechanism:
[5]    - Modified patch_tool_messages to use synthesize_error_response
[5]    - Enhanced retry-prompt handling to extract error info
[5]    - Updated orphaned tool error handling
[5]
[5] 3. Testing:
[5]    - 12 unit tests covering all error types and edge cases
[5]    - 4 integration tests verifying retry flow
[5]    - All tests passing
[5]
[5] 4. Code is clean and modular per requirements
