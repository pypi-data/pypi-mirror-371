# Task 11: Update setup_dev_env.sh script to ensure robust dependency installation
_Started: 2025-07-29 11:10:04_
_Agent: default

[1] Analyzed current setup_dev_env.sh script. Key findings:
[1] - No explicit pydantic or pydantic-ai verification after installation
[1] - Uses --quiet flag which suppresses error messages
[1] - No rollback mechanism if installation fails
[1] - No logging of installation steps
[1] - No version compatibility checks
[1] - Simple verify installation section only shows tool versions, not actual import tests
[2] Identified critical dependencies from pyproject.toml:
[2] - Core: pydantic-ai[logfire]==0.2.6 (the critical dependency mentioned in issue)
[2] - Other runtime deps: typer, prompt_toolkit, pygments, rich, tiktoken
[2] - Dev deps: pytest-asyncio (explicitly installed in script)
[2] - Python requirement: >=3.10
[2]
[2] Current script issues:
[2] 1. pip install -e .[dev] --quiet suppresses errors
[2] 2. No verification that pydantic-ai actually installed successfully
[2] 3. No import tests to confirm modules are accessible
[3] Created enhanced setup_dev_env.sh script with:
[3] 1. ✓ Explicit pydantic-ai installation and verification
[3] 2. ✓ Detailed logging to setup_dev_env.log
[3] 3. ✓ Import tests for all critical packages
[3] 4. ✓ Retry mechanism for failed installations
[3] 5. ✓ Rollback on failure (removes incomplete venv)
[3] 6. ✓ Virtual environment activation verification
[3] 7. ✓ Version compatibility info on failure
[3] 8. ✓ Final test run to verify everything works
[4] Validation results:
[4] ✓ All key features implemented in updated script
[4] ✓ Import verification, logging, retry, and rollback all present
[4] ✓ Most packages import successfully in current env
[4] ⚠ tiktoken import failed (expected - not all packages installed in current env)
[4]
[4] Key improvements delivered:
[4] 1. Explicit pydantic-ai[logfire]==0.2.6 installation with verification
[4] 2. Import tests for all critical packages after installation
[4] 3. Detailed logging to setup_dev_env.log
[4] 4. Retry mechanism (3 attempts) for failed installations
[4] 5. Rollback removes incomplete venv on failure
[4] 6. Better error messages with diagnostic info
[4] 7. Virtual env activation verification
[4] 8. Final test run with test_import.py
