# System Patterns

## System Architecture
TunaCode follows a modular architecture with clearly defined components:

1. **CLI Layer**: Command-line interface handling user input and output
2. **Core Services**: Business logic and core functionality
3. **Tool Components**: Specialized tools for specific tasks (grep, file operations, etc.)
4. **Utility Layer**: Common utilities and helper functions
5. **Configuration Management**: Settings and configuration handling
6. **Testing Framework**: Comprehensive test suite for validation

The architecture emphasizes loose coupling between components and clear separation of concerns.

## Key Technical Decisions

### Refactoring Approach
- **Incremental Refactoring**: Small, focused changes with continuous testing
- **Characterization Testing**: Comprehensive tests before and after changes
- **Backward Compatibility**: Preserve existing APIs unless explicitly required to change
- **Modern Python Standards**: Apply contemporary practices consistently

### Module Decomposition
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each module has one clear purpose
- **Size Constraints**: Modules should be under 500 lines
- **Functional Cohesion**: Related functionality grouped together
- **Clear Interfaces**: Well-defined APIs between components

### Testing Strategy
- **Characterization Testing**: Preserve existing behavior during refactoring
- **Unit Testing**: Validate individual components
- **Integration Testing**: Ensure components work together
- **Regression Testing**: Prevent introduction of new issues

## Design Patterns in Use

### Command Pattern
Used in the CLI implementation to encapsulate requests as objects, enabling parameterization of clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.

### Factory Pattern
Used for creating different types of tools and components based on configuration or user input.

### Observer Pattern
Used for event handling and notifications between components.

### Strategy Pattern
Used for implementing different algorithms for similar tasks (e.g., different search strategies).

### Decorator Pattern
Used for adding additional responsibilities to objects dynamically.

## Component Relationships

### Core Components
- `main.py`: Entry point and core agent logic
- `repl.py`: Interactive command-line interface
- `grep.py`: Pattern searching functionality

### Supporting Components
- **Tool Components**: Specialized tools for file operations, code analysis, etc.
- **Utility Modules**: Common helper functions and utilities
- **Configuration Modules**: Settings and configuration management
- **Testing Modules**: Test cases and validation logic

### Dependency Flow
1. CLI layer depends on core services
2. Core services depend on tool components
3. Tool components depend on utilities
4. Utilities have minimal or no dependencies
5. Configuration is injected where needed
6. Testing modules depend on the components they test

## Critical Implementation Paths

### File Decomposition
1. Analyze existing large files for logical separations
2. Extract cohesive components into separate modules
3. Maintain existing APIs through adapter layers if needed
4. Update imports and references throughout the codebase
5. Validate behavior through comprehensive testing

### Modern Python Standards Adoption
1. Add type hints to all public interfaces
2. Convert data structures to use dataclasses
3. Replace os.path with pathlib operations
4. Implement context managers for resource handling
5. Convert string constants to Enums
6. Apply consistent code formatting and style

### Testing Enhancement
1. Expand characterization test coverage
2. Add unit tests for new modular components
3. Implement integration tests for component interactions
4. Set up continuous testing infrastructure
5. Monitor test coverage metrics
