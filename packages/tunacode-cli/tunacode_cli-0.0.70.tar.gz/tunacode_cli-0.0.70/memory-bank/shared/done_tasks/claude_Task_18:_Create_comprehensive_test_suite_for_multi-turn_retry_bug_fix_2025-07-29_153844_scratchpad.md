[1] Analyze existing code structure to understand retry mechanism implementation
[2] Analyzed existing code structure - found:
[2] 1. Retry mechanism is already implemented in core/agents/main.py with should_retry() function
[2] 2. Error synthesis already exists with synthesize_error_response() function
[2] 3. TextPart handling is already in cli/repl.py _attempt_tool_recovery() function
[2] 4. SessionState already tracks retry_attempts and max_retries (2)
[2] 5. Some related tests exist but need comprehensive test suite
[3] Created todo list to track test creation progress - will implement modular, clean test code for each component
[4] Created test_retry_mechanism.py with comprehensive unit tests for:
[4] - should_retry() function with various retry counts
[4] - SessionState retry_attempts tracking
[4] - Max retry limit enforcement (max_retries=2)
[4] - Retry count persistence across tool calls
[4] - Exception tracking alongside retry attempts
[5] Created test_textpart_handling.py with comprehensive tests for:
[5] - _attempt_tool_recovery() method with TextPart objects
[5] - Defensive type checking for text vs content attributes
[5] - hasattr() checks and isinstance() validation
[5] - Error handling for objects lacking expected attributes
[5] - Mixed part types and attribute access errors
[6] Created test_error_synthesis.py with comprehensive tests for:
[6] - synthesize_error_response() function with various exception types
[6] - FileNotFoundError message formatting with different file paths
[6] - PermissionError handling for files and directories
[6] - Generic exception handling with retry count information
[6] - Edge cases: empty messages, unicode, special characters
[7] Created test_retry_scenarios.py with integration tests for:
[7] - End-to-end retry flow from tool failure to user-friendly error
[7] - Multi-tool failure recovery scenarios
[7] - Message history cleanup in patch_tool_messages()
[7] - Complete retry cycle with limit enforcement
[7] - Retry prompt handling and removal
[7] - Tool exception tracking and cleanup
[8] Created test_normal_operations.py with regression tests for:
[8] - Normal tool operations without retries remain unchanged
[8] - Successful tool executions are not affected by retry mechanism
[8] - Message history preservation for successful operations
[8] - Performance impact validation (minimal overhead)
[8] - Error handling without retries (max_retries=0)
[8] - Backward compatibility with existing APIs
[9] Added test coverage configuration:
[9] - Updated pytest.ini with coverage settings (90% fail-under)
[9] - Created .coveragerc with detailed coverage configuration
[9] - Added Makefile targets for retry-specific tests:
[9]   - test-retry: Run all retry mechanism tests
[9]   - coverage-retry: Generate coverage report for retry code
[9] - Coverage will track branch coverage and exclude non-testable code
