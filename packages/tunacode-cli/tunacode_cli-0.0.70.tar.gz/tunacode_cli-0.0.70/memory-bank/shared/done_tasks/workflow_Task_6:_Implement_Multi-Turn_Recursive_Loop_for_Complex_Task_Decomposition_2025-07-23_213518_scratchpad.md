# Task 6: Implement Multi-Turn Recursive Loop for Complex Task Decomposition
_Started: 2025-07-23 21:20:33_
_Agent: workflow

[1] Created feature branch feature/recursive-task-execution and initialized recursive module directory structure
[2] Implemented RecursiveTaskExecutor class with core functionality for task complexity analysis, decomposition, and recursive execution
[3] Enhanced SessionState with recursion tracking fields and StateManager with recursive context management methods
[4] Implemented TaskDecomposer class that uses the main agent for intelligent task analysis and breakdown, replacing DSPy dependency
[5] Implemented TaskHierarchy class for managing parent-child task relationships, dependencies, and execution state with full DAG validation
[6] Implemented BudgetManager class with sophisticated budget allocation strategies, consumption tracking, and dynamic reallocation capabilities
[7] Integrated RecursiveTaskExecutor into process_request function with complexity detection and fallback to normal execution
[8] Implemented ResultAggregator class with intelligent result merging, context synthesis, and conflict resolution capabilities
[9] Implemented RecursiveProgressUI class with comprehensive visualization including task hierarchy, budget status, execution stack, and progress tracking
