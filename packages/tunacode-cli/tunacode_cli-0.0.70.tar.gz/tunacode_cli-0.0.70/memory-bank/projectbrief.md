# Project Brief

## Purpose
This document serves as the foundation for the TunaCode project refactoring initiative, defining core requirements, goals, and scope. It shapes all other memory bank files and provides the source of truth for project direction.

## Project Overview
TunaCode is a Python-based CLI tool that provides code analysis and manipulation capabilities. The project is currently undergoing a significant refactoring effort to improve maintainability and readability by reducing large Python files into smaller, more manageable modules.

## Core Requirements
1. **File Size Reduction**: Break down large Python files (>500 lines) into smaller, focused modules
2. **Maintain Behavior Preservation**: Ensure all existing functionality remains intact through comprehensive characterization testing
3. **Modern Python Standards**: Apply contemporary Python practices including type hints, dataclasses, and pathlib
4. **Performance Maintenance**: Ensure refactoring does not introduce performance regressions
5. **Test Coverage**: Maintain and improve test coverage throughout the refactoring process

## Project Goals
- Improve code maintainability and readability
- Enhance developer productivity through better code organization
- Apply modern Python best practices consistently
- Preserve all existing functionality and APIs
- Establish a solid foundation for future feature development

## Project Scope
The refactoring initiative focuses on three primary target files:
- `./src/tunacode/tools/grep.py` (694 lines)
- `./src/tunacode/cli/repl.py` (578 lines)
- `./src/tunacode/core/agents/main.py` (1613 lines)

Each file will be decomposed into smaller modules while maintaining behavioral compatibility.

## Success Criteria
- All refactored files under 500 lines
- All characterization tests passing
- No performance regression
- Improved code organization and readability
- Type safety through annotations
- Modern Python idioms applied

## Constraints
- No breaking changes to public APIs unless explicitly required
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Follow existing code style and patterns
- Incremental approach with small, focused commits
- Each new file must be under 500 lines

## Stakeholders
- Development team responsible for implementation
- Users relying on existing functionality
- Future maintainers of the codebase
