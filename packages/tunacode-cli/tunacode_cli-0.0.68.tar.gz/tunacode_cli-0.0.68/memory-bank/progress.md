# Progress

## What Works

### Completed Refactoring
- âœ… `./src/tunacode/tools/grep.py` (694 lines) - Successfully decomposed into smaller components:
  - `pattern_matcher.py` - Pattern matching logic
  - `file_filter.py` - File filtering logic
  - `result_formatter.py` - Result formatting logic
  - `search_result.py` - Search result data structure
- âœ… Characterization testing for all target files
- âœ… Dead code removal from target files
- âœ… Rollback points established for safety
- âœ… Phase 1: Constants & Enums - Converted string constants to type-safe enums:
  - `ToolName` enum for tool identification
  - `TodoStatus` and `TodoPriority` enums for todo management
  - All configuration files updated to use enums
- âœ… Phase 2: Type Hints Enhancement - Added comprehensive type annotations:
  - Added return type to `get_agent_tool()` function
  - Added type hints to `ToolUI.show_confirmation()`
  - Discovered tools already had comprehensive type annotations
  - Fixed import ordering issues

### Functioning Components
- Core CLI functionality
- REPL interface
- Agent main processing
- Grep tool with enhanced capabilities
- Comprehensive test suite
- Development environment setup
- Code quality tools (linting, formatting, type checking)

### Validation
- âœ… All characterization tests passing (292 tests passing, 0 failures, 12 skipped)
- âœ… All 4 previously failing tests fixed:
  - `test_process_request_with_thoughts_enabled` - Fixed mock to simulate tool calls
  - `test_process_request_message_history_copy` - Created copy of messages list
  - `test_patch_tool_messages_with_orphans` - Corrected patch path
  - `test_patch_tool_messages_mixed_scenario` - Corrected patch path
- No performance regression detected
- Type hints added to public interfaces
- Modern Python idioms applied where appropriate

## What's Left to Build

### Pending Refactoring Work
- ðŸ”„ `./src/tunacode/cli/repl.py` (578 lines) - Decomposition pending:
  - Extract `command_parser.py` - Command parsing logic
  - Extract `input_handler.py` - Input handling
  - Extract `output_formatter.py` - Output formatting
- ðŸ”„ `./src/tunacode/core/agents/main.py` (1613 lines) - Decomposition pending:
  - Extract `tools/` subdirectory for tool definitions
  - Extract `agent_config.py` - Agent configuration
  - Extract `message_handler.py` - Message handling
  - Extract `response_processor.py` - Response processing logic
  - Extract `tool_executor.py` - Tool execution and parallelization

### Modern Python Standards Application
- âœ… Type hints for all methods (Phase 2 complete)
- âœ… Enum for constants (Phase 1 complete - ToolName, TodoStatus, TodoPriority)
- ðŸ”„ Dataclasses for data structures (Phase 3 - pending)
- ðŸ”„ Pathlib instead of os.path (Phase 4 - pending)
- ðŸ”„ Context managers for resources (pending)

## Current Status

### Phase Completion (Refactoring)
- âœ… Phase 1: Characterization Testing - COMPLETED
- âœ… Phase 2: Create Rollback Points - COMPLETED
- âœ… Phase 3: Dead Code Removal - COMPLETED
- ðŸ”„ Phase 4: File Decomposition - IN PROGRESS
- ðŸ”„ Phase 5: Apply Modern Python Standards - IN PROGRESS

### Phase Completion (Modern Python Standards)
- âœ… Phase 1: Constants & Enums - COMPLETED (2025-08-04)
- âœ… Phase 2: Type Hints Enhancement - COMPLETED (2025-08-04)
- ðŸ”„ Phase 3: Dataclass Adoption - PENDING
- ðŸ”„ Phase 4: Path Handling Modernization - PENDING
- ðŸ”„ Phase 5: Documentation & Validation - PENDING

### Active Development Focus
- Continuing file decomposition for repl.py and main.py
- Applying modern Python standards throughout the codebase
- Expanding test coverage for new components
- Improving documentation and code comments

## Known Issues

### Test Related
- âœ… All tests now passing (previously had 8 failing tests - all fixed)
- Some tests may require updates after file decomposition

### Code Quality
- Inconsistent application of modern Python standards across the codebase
- Some modules still exceed the 500-line target
- Documentation gaps in newly created components

### Technical Debt
- Legacy code patterns in undecomposed files
- Potential circular import issues with new modular structure
- Inconsistent error handling patterns across components

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Approach
- Focus on characterization testing before any refactoring
- Establish rollback points for safety
- Apply incremental approach with small, focused commits

### Refined Strategy
- Prioritize grep.py decomposition as proof of concept
- Create dedicated component directories for better organization
- Apply modern Python standards alongside file decomposition
- Enhance testing strategy with more comprehensive coverage

### Current Direction
- Continue decomposition of remaining large files
- Focus on maintaining backward compatibility
- Apply modern Python practices consistently
- Improve developer experience through better tooling and documentation

## Next Milestones

1. Complete file decomposition for repl.py
2. Complete file decomposition for main.py
3. Apply type hints throughout the codebase
4. Convert data structures to use dataclasses
5. Replace os.path operations with pathlib equivalents
6. Implement context managers for resource handling
7. Convert string constants to Enums
8. Final validation of all characterization tests
9. Performance benchmarking
10. Documentation updates for all changes

## Success Tracking

### Metrics
- File size reduction (all files under 500 lines)
- Test coverage percentage
- Code quality scores (linting, type checking)
- Performance benchmarks
- Developer experience feedback

### Validation Points
- Regular test execution (pytest tests/characterization/)
- Continuous linting and formatting checks
- Periodic performance benchmarking
- Code review feedback integration
