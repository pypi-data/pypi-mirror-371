# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
The TunaCode project is currently in the active phase of refactoring large Python files to improve maintainability and readability. The refactoring work is ongoing with a focus on breaking down large files into smaller, more manageable modules while preserving all existing functionality.

## Recent Changes
- Implementation of grep.py decomposition with new components:
  - `pattern_matcher.py` - Pattern matching logic
  - `file_filter.py` - File filtering logic
  - `result_formatter.py` - Result formatting logic
  - `search_result.py` - Search result data structure
- Completed Phase 1: Constants & Enums (2025-08-04):
  - Implemented `ToolName` enum with backward compatibility
  - Created `TodoStatus` and `TodoPriority` enums
  - Updated all configuration files to use enums
  - Fixed 35 failing tests due to refactoring import changes
- Completed Phase 2: Type Hints Enhancement (2025-08-04):
  - Added return type annotation to `get_agent_tool()` function
  - Added type hints to `ToolUI.show_confirmation()` for StateManager parameter
  - Discovered tools already had comprehensive type annotations
  - Fixed import ordering issues flagged by ruff
  - Created comprehensive test suite with 11 type hint tests
- Resolved all test failures (292 tests passing, 0 failures, 12 skipped):
  - Fixed test_process_request_with_thoughts_enabled
  - Fixed test_process_request_message_history_copy
  - Fixed test_patch_tool_messages_with_orphans
  - Fixed test_patch_tool_messages_mixed_scenario

## Next Steps
1. Begin Phase 3: Dataclass Adoption
   - Write tests for `ResponseState` as dataclass
   - Convert `ResponseState` to dataclass
   - Identify other dataclass candidates
   - Implement remaining dataclass conversions
2. Continue Phase 4: Path Handling Modernization
   - Replace `os.path` with `pathlib.Path`
   - Update file handling in tools modules
   - Ensure cross-platform compatibility
3. Complete Phase 5: Documentation & Validation
   - Update MODERN_PYTHON_STANDARDS_UPDATES.md
   - Run comprehensive test suite
   - Validate performance hasn't regressed
4. Continue file decomposition for repl.py and main.py
5. Implement context managers for resource handling

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Maintaining backward compatibility while improving code structure
- Balancing refactoring progress with ongoing feature development
- Ensuring comprehensive test coverage during transformation
- Managing dependencies between refactored components

## Target Files for Refactoring
- `./src/tunacode/tools/grep.py` (694 lines)
- `./src/tunacode/cli/repl.py` (578 lines)
- `./src/tunacode/core/agents/main.py` (1613 lines)

## Success Metrics
- All refactored files under 500 lines
- All characterization tests passing
- No performance regression
- Improved code organization and readability
- Type safety through annotations
- Modern Python idioms applied

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Incremental refactoring approach with small, focused commits
- Comprehensive characterization testing before and after changes
- Preservation of public APIs unless explicitly required to change
- Use of modern Python features (type hints, dataclasses, pathlib, context managers, Enums)
- Clear documentation of changes and rationale

## Learnings and Project Insights
- Characterization testing is critical for safe refactoring
- Breaking down large files reveals hidden complexity and interdependencies
- Modern Python features significantly improve code readability and maintainability
- Incremental approach allows for continuous validation and easier rollback if needed
- Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for modern Python standards proved highly effective:
  - Writing tests first ensured we knew exactly what changes were needed
  - Tests guided the implementation and caught issues early
  - All phases completed with tests passing
- Fixing test failures requires understanding both the test expectations and actual behavior
- Import path corrections are critical when refactoring module structures
- Type annotations were already well-implemented in many parts of the codebase
