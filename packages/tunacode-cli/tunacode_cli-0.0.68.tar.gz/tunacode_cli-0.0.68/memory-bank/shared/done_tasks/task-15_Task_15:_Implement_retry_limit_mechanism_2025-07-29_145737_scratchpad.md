# Task 15: Implement retry limit mechanism
_Started: 2025-07-29 14:47:08_
_Agent: task-15

[1] Analyzed bug report - Key findings:
[1] - Need to add retry_attempts dict to SessionState to track tool_call_id attempts
[1] - Implement should_retry() function with max_retries=2 limit
[1] - Integrate into existing retry logic in main.py
[1] - Add reset mechanism for completed tool calls
[1] - Ensure clean, modular code structure
[2] Created task breakdown:
[2] 1. Update SessionState with retry_attempts dict
[2] 2. Create should_retry() function
[2] 3. Integrate into existing retry logic
[2] 4. Add reset mechanism
[2] 5. Add logging
[2] 6. Create unit tests
[2] 7. Create integration tests
[3] Completed SessionState updates:
[3] - Added retry_attempts dict to track tool_call_id -> attempt count
[3] - Added max_retries constant set to 2
[3] - Added reset_retry_count() method to StateManager
[3] - Code is clean and follows existing patterns
[4] Found key locations:
[4] - _tool_handler in cli/repl.py handles tool execution
[4] - Tools raise ModelRetry exceptions to request retries
[4] - Need to intercept ModelRetry in tool handler and check should_retry() before re-raising
[5] Need to find where ModelRetry exceptions are caught. The tool handler must call the actual tool functions and handle their exceptions. Looking for the execution path.
[6] Analyzed the code structure:
[6] - Pydantic-ai Tool class already has max_retries parameter
[6] - Tools are registered with max_retries=3 in get_or_create_agent
[6] - Need to create tool wrappers that check should_retry() before allowing retries
[6] - This will prevent infinite loops by enforcing our limit
[7] Reconsidering approach:
[7] - Pydantic-ai already has max_retries on Tool() registration
[7] - The bug report shows retry-prompts are tracked in patch_tool_messages
[7] - Instead of wrapping tools, we should modify get_or_create_agent to use our max_retries from state
[7] - And ensure retry tracking happens when retry-prompts are detected
[8] Completed integration of should_retry() into patch_tool_messages:
[8] - When retry-prompt is detected, check if retry limit exceeded
[8] - If exceeded, add error response and mark as handled
[8] - This prevents infinite retry loops
[8]
[8] Now creating unit tests for the retry mechanism
[9] Implementation completed successfully:
[9] - Added retry_attempts tracking to SessionState with max_retries=2
[9] - Created should_retry() function to track and limit retries
[9] - Integrated retry checking into patch_tool_messages to prevent infinite loops
[9] - Added comprehensive unit and integration tests (20 tests, all passing)
[9] - Code is clean, modular, and follows project conventions
[9] - Linting passes with no issues
