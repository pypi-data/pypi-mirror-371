## Master


## Release 2.11.0
* add multilabel input support to `totalseg_combine_masks`
* remove numpy < 2 requirement
* add `teeth` task
* **IMPORTANT**: increase nnunetv2 requirement from >=2.2.1 to >=2.3.1 to support model trained on the latest nnunetv2 version (2.6.2) (i.e. `teeth` task)


## Release 2.10.0
* add `abdominal_muscles` task


## Release 2.9.0
* use `--higher_order_resampling` argument
* add `--save_probabilities` argument: save softmax probabilities. Very experimental. Requires python skills.
* bugfix in task `brain_structures`: resampling was in different order than model, resulting in slower runtime and higher RAM usage and slightly reduced accuracy.
* add `craniofacial_structures` task: add skull, mandible, teeth, sinus, etc.


## Release 2.8.0
* make `totalseg_get_modality` work with normalized intensities (images which do not have original HU values anymore)
* replace pkg_resources for python 3.12 compatibility
* remove torch < 2.6.0 requirement (fixed in nnU-Net)
* add `--robust_crop`
* improved `tissue_types_mr` model
* add mode `nearest` to ndimage.zoom to fix resampling [bug](https://github.com/wasserth/TotalSegmentator/issues/458) (thanks to @baderstine for spotting this bug)


## Release 2.7.0
* add `liver_segments` and `liver_segments_mr` tasks


## Release 2.6.0
* add evans index calculation
* require torch < 2.6.0 to avoid weight loading error (waiting for nnU-Net to fix this issue)


## Release 2.5.0
* **major update to all MR models**: double the number of training subjects (this includes a retraining of these models. Therefore results can be different from previous versions.)
* **breaking change**: the `total_mr` task now contains 50 main classes instead of 56. Some classes moved to some other tasks and `total_mr` now contains also some classes which were not part of it previously. Please see the new `total_mr` class map in the readme or in `totalsegmentator/map_to_binary.py`.
* add `tissue_4_types` task: add intermuscular fat class
* add `vertebrae_mr` task: numbered single vertebrae segmentation in MR images (for CT this is already part of the `total` task)
* add `appendicular_bones_mr` task: add appendicular bones segmentation for MR images
* add `thigh_shoulder_muscles_mr` task: add thigh and shoulder muscles segmentation for CT and MR images
* add `vertebrae_body` with new class `intervertebral_discs`
* add `body_mr` task: add body segmentation for MR images
* add `kidney_cysts` task: greatly improved kidney cyst segmentation compared to the `kidney_cyst` class which is part of `total` task
* add `breasts` task: add breast segmentation
* add `oculomotor_muscles` task: add oculomotor muscles model (thanks to Philippe)
* add `lung_nodules` task (thanks to [BLUEMIND AI](https://bluemind.co/))
* update `coronary_arteries` task: increased number of training subjects, including non-contrast images
* add option to remove small connected components in postprocessing
* add `totalseg_get_modality`: estimate modality (CT or MR) from input image
* removed `rt_utils` and `p_tqdm` dependency
* change pi_time threshold for arterial late phase from 50s to 60s


## Release 2.4.0

## Release 2.1.0
* Bugfix: add flush to DummyFile

* from python api also return nifti with label map in header
* input to python api can be a Nifti1Image object or a file path
* upgrade to `nnunetv2>=2.2.1`
* for `total` task use nnU-Net `step_size=0.8` instead of `0.5` for faster runtime while only decreasing dice by 0.001

## Release 2.0.5
* downgrade nnunet to 2.1 to fix bug in `fast` model


## Release 2.0.4
* temporary fix of critical bug in `fast` model. Proper fix in next release.


## LEGACY BUGFIX Release 1.5.7
* download all weights from github releases instead of zenodo
