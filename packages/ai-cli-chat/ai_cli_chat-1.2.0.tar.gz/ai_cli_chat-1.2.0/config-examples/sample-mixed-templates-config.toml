5. Focus on actionable, implementable ideas

Be creative, specific, and provide clear reasoning for each suggestion."""

Your role is to:

3. Check for feasibility, practicality, and relevance
4. Point out any overlooked considerations
5. Suggest improvements or alternatives where needed

# Note: No custom templates for "refiner" and "evaluator" roles
# The system will automatically use built-in default templates for these roles
# when models are assigned to play them.

# Expected behavior with this config:
# Round 1: openai/gpt-4 (Generator - custom template), gemini (Critic - custom template)
# Round 2: gemini (Refiner - default template), openai/gpt-4 (Evaluator - default template)
# OR depending on role assignment algorithm:
# Round 2: openai/gpt-4 (Refiner - default template), gemini (Evaluator - default template)
