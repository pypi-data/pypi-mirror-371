# MKCD - Linux Utilities for Windows

Tired of switching between PowerShell and WSL just to use basic Linux commands? MKCD brings over 70 essential Linux utilities directly to your Windows command line. No virtual machines, no containers, no hassle.

## Why MKCD?

Working on Windows but miss the power of Linux command-line tools? You're not alone. Whether you're a developer who needs `grep` for quick searches, a sysadmin who relies on `tail` for log monitoring, or anyone who finds Windows equivalents just don't cut it, MKCD has you covered.

MKCD provides native Windows executables for all your favorite Linux utilities:
- **Text processing**: `grep`, `sed`, `awk`, `cut`, `sort`, `uniq`
- **File operations**: `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `find`, `chmod`
- **System monitoring**: `ps`, `top`, `df`, `du`, `stat`
- **Archive handling**: `tar`, `gzip`, `gunzip`, `zip`
- **And many more**: `head`, `tail`, `cat`, `wc`, `diff`, `which`, `whereis`

No learning curve. No compatibility issues. Just the Linux tools you know and love, running natively on Windows.

## Installation

Getting started with MKCD is straightforward, but there are a few important steps to follow:

### Step 1: Install the Package
```powershell
pip install mkcd
```

### Step 2: Run the Installer
```powershell
mkcd-install
```

This will:
1. Launch a User Account Control (UAC) dialog asking for administrator privileges
2. Click "Yes" to grant permission (required to modify system PATH)
3. Open a new elevated command window
4. After the installation completes and shows "Operation completed. Press any key to close this window...", press Enter
5. The elevated window will close automatically

### Step 3: Open a New Terminal
**Important**: You must open a completely new terminal window for the changes to take effect. Simply opening a new tab in Windows Terminal may not work - you need to close and reopen the entire application.

If commands still aren't recognized after opening a new terminal, a system restart may be required.

## Quick Start

Once installed, you can immediately start using Linux commands in any Windows terminal:

```powershell
# List files with details and colors
ls -la

# Search for text in files
grep "error" *.log

# Monitor log files in real-time
tail -f application.log

# Find files by name
find . -name "*.txt"

# Count lines, words, and characters
wc myfile.txt

# Extract archives
tar -xzf archive.tar.gz
```

## Colorized Output

MKCD automatically enables colorized output for `ls` and `grep` commands, making your terminal experience more pleasant and easier to read.

## Troubleshooting

### Commands Not Found After Installation
- Make sure you opened a completely new terminal (not just a new tab)
- Try restarting your computer
- Check if the installation succeeded by running `mkcd-install` again

### UAC Prompts
The installer needs administrator privileges to modify your system PATH. This is normal and safe - we only modify environment variables to make the Linux utilities available system-wide.

### Uninstalling
To remove MKCD utilities from your PATH:
```powershell
mkcd-uninstall
```

To completely remove the package:
```powershell
pip uninstall mkcd
```
