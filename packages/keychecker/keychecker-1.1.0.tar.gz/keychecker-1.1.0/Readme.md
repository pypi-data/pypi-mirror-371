# 🔑 KeyChecker

_A fast CLI tool to fingerprint SSH private keys and identify which Git hosting accounts they unlock (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Codeberg, Gitea, Hugging Face)._

> 🔬 **Part of Cyfinoid Research's Software Supply Chain Security Research**  
> This tool is created by [Cyfinoid Research](https://cyfinoid.com/research/software-supply-chain-security/) as part of our offensive tooling research focused on identification of next steps once an SSH private key is discovered. Learn more about our software supply chain security research and training programs.

## ✨ Features

### 🔍 Key Intelligence
- **Multi-format support**: OpenSSH, PEM, and DER private key formats
- **Key type detection**: `ed25519`, `rsa`, `ecdsa`, `dsa` with security analysis
- **Security validation**: Flags deprecated/insecure algorithms and weak key sizes
- **Passphrase detection**: Identifies if private keys are encrypted
- **Metadata extraction**: Public key, fingerprints (SHA256/MD5), and comments
- **Insight parsing**: Extracts local username, hostname, and IP addresses from comments

### 🌐 Account Discovery
- **Multi-provider support**: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Codeberg, Gitea, Hugging Face
- **Safe SSH handshakes**: Read-only validation without triggering repo operations
- **Username extraction**: Parses SSH identity banners to recover mapped usernames
- **Organization discovery**: Identifies user membership in organizations (GitHub API)

### 📁 Repository Discovery
- **Private repo detection**: Uses `git ls-remote` probes with wordlists

## 🔐 Security Notes

- **Read-only operations**: No repositorywrite operations performed
- **Local processing**: Private keys are processed in-memory, never uploaded
- **Authorized use only**: Only use against keys you own or are authorized to test
- **SSH handshake logging**: Some providers may log SSH connections - use responsibly

## 🛠 Development

### Setup Development Environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cyfinoid/keychecker
cd keychecker

# Install uv (if not already installed)
./scripts/install.sh

# Set up development environment
./scripts/setup-dev.sh

# Run tests
./scripts/test.sh

# Run demo
uv run python examples/demo.py
```

```

### Adding New Providers

KeyChecker uses a plugin architecture for Git hosting providers. To add a new provider:

1. Create a new provider class in `keychecker/plugins/`
2. Inherit from `BaseGitProvider`
3. Implement required methods: `validate_key()`, `identify_user()`, `discover_organizations()`
4. Register the provider in `keychecker/plugins/__init__.py`

### Development Scripts

The project includes shell scripts to automate common tasks:

```bash
# Install uv (if needed)
./scripts/install.sh

# Set up development environment
./scripts/setup-dev.sh

# Run tests and quality checks
./scripts/test.sh

# Clean development environment
./scripts/clean.sh

# Build package for distribution
./scripts/build.sh

# Update version number
./scripts/version.sh 1.0.2
```

## Release Workflow

```bash
# Test publication workflow (recommended)
# 1. Use GitHub Actions to publish to TestPyPI:
#    - Go to Actions tab → "Publish to PyPI" → "Run workflow"
#    - Enter a test version (e.g., 1.0.2-rc1)
#    - This will test installation with pip, pipx, and uv (with --pre flag for pre-releases)
# 2. Create a GitHub release to publish to PyPI:
#    - Version consistency is automatically verified
#    - Production publication with full testing (stable versions only)
```
### Alternatives

```bash
# Manual publication (alternative)
export TESTPYPI_API_TOKEN=your_token
./scripts/publish-testpypi.sh

export PYPI_API_TOKEN=your_token
./scripts/publish-pypi.sh
```

See `scripts/README.md` for detailed script documentation.

## 📊 Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | Success |
| `1` | Runtime/IO/argument error |
| `2` | All servers unreachable |
| `3` | Repository discovery attempted, no repositories found |
| `4` | Key parsed but flagged (deprecated/insecure) |

---

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- **Self-hosted environments**: Support for custom GitLab, Bitbucket, and Gitea instances
- **Arbitrary hosts**: Generic SSH server validation with custom host/port configuration
- **Host discovery**: Automatic detection of Git server type and capabilities
- **Cloud Git platforms**: Support for Azure DevOps, AWS CodeCommit, Google Cloud Source Repositories
- **Enterprise platforms**: Integration with enterprise Git solutions
- **Public repository filtering**: Skip public repositories during discovery (no point in bruteforcing)
- **Intelligent wordlists**: Generate repository name candidates based on discovered organizations
- **Rate limit awareness**: Adaptive discovery speed based on server rate limits

### Quality of Life Improvement

- **OIDC Publication**: Move publication and release to OIDC aware setup
