# ServiceNow MCP Server

A comprehensive, production-ready MCP server for interacting with various modules in a ServiceNow instance. This server exposes a rich set of tools for managing Incidents, Changes, Users, Service Catalog, and more.

## Features

- **Modular Design:** Tools are organized by ServiceNow application (Incident, Change, Agile, etc.).
- **Production-Ready:** Robust Pydantic models for input validation and clear schemas.
- **Extensible:** Easily add new tools and modules.
- **Distributable:** Can be installed as a standard Python package via `pip`.

## Installation

1.  **Prerequisites:** Python 3.8+
2.  **Install from source:**

    git clone <your-git-repo-url>
    cd servicenow-mcp-server
    pip install -e .

    *(Note: In the future, if you publish to PyPI, this would be `pip install snow-mcp`)*

## Configuration

This server uses a client-side credential model. The client application is responsible for passing the ServiceNow instance URL, username, and password with every tool call inside the `params` object.

**Example Payload Structure:**
```json
{
  "params": {
    "instance_url": "https://your-instance.service-now.com",
    "username": "your_api_user",
    "password": "your_api_password",
    // ... other tool-specific parameters ...
  }
}
```

## Usage

Once installed, the server can be started by any MCP client that knows its command.

### Starting the Server Manually
You can run the server directly from your terminal:
```bash
servicenow-mcp-server
```

### Example Client (`test_client.py`)

An example client is provided to demonstrate how to call the server's tools. It can be run from the project's root directory:
```bash
python test/test_client.py 
```
*(You may need to move your test client to a `test/` directory at the root level for clarity)*
