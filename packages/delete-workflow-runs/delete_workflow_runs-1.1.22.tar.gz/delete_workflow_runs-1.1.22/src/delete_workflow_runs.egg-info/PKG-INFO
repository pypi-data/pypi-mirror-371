## ✅ What does delete-workflow-runs do?
**delete-workflow-runs** deletes workflow runs in GitHub repository.

<br>

<!--
## 😎 Why we create delete-workflow-runs?
**delete-workflow-runs** was created because some of the _most popular "delete workflow runs"_ actions on the GitHub marketplace:
- are not regularly updated (_supply chain risk_).
- do not show evidence of tests (_supply chain risk_).
- do not identify orphan workflow runs to delete (_eat up costs for no reason_).
- do not provide supportive information before a delete operation (_business risk you can't ignore_).
-->

## ⭐ Why switch to delete-workflow-runs?
- we reduce your supply chain risks with [openssf best practices](https://best.openssf.org) in our SDLC and operations.
- we identify orphan workflow runs that should be deleted when the parent workflow is deleted.
- we produce _API rate limit consumption estimate in dry-run_, so you can plan your delete task properly.
- we share evidence of code coverage results in action (click _Code Coverage » cron-tasks » badge-coverage_).
- we can run using [command line](https://github.com/tagdots/delete-workflow-runs?tab=readme-ov-file#-running-delete-workflow-runs-from-command-line) or GitHub Action [Delete GitHub Workflow Runs](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/delete-github-workflow-runs).

<br>

## 🏃 Running _delete-workflow-runs_ in GitHub action

Use the workflow examples below to create your own workflow inside `.github/workflows/`.

<br>

### Example 1 - Summary (MOCK Delete)
| Input | Workflow Spec | Result
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `scheduled run` | `- cron: '30 17 * * *'` | Run daily at 5:30 pm UTC
| `github token permissions` | `actions: read`<br>`contents: read` | MOCK delete requires read permission |
| `min-runs` | `10` | Keep the last 10 workflow runs for each workflow |
| `dry-run` | `true` | a. MOCK delete<br>b. Produce API rate limit consumption estimate<br>c. Get the JSON log file  |

### Example 1 - Workflow (MOCK Delete)
```yml
name: delete-github-workflow-runs

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '30 17 * * *'

permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read

jobs:
  delete-workflow-runs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      actions: read
      contents: read

    - name: Run delete-workflow-runs
      id: delete-workflow-runs
      uses: tagdots/delete-workflow-runs@6384f56e65ab6e4e2e7193b3cffd3aae93b4636a # 1.1.18
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        repo-url: ${{ github.repository }}
        min-runs: 10
        dry-run: true

    - name: Get data
      id: get_data
      shell: bash
      run: |
        # get data from the last step
        cat data_dict.log | jq .
```

### Example 1 - Sample JSON Data File Output

Get the data output (data_dict.log) and extrat fields if necessary to:

- perform permanent delete after the dry-run if the usage estimate is below some threshold
- notify users if workflow-runs count is above an abnormal level
- ...etc.

<br>

### Example 2 - Summary (Irreversible delete)

| Input | Workflow Spec | Result
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `scheduled run` | `- cron: '30 17 * * *'` | Run daily at 5:30 pm UTC
| `github token permissions` | `actions: write`<br>`contents: read` | Delete requires write permission in `actions` |
| `max-days` | `10` | Keep workflow runs in the last 10 days for each workflow |
| `dry-run` | `false` | a. Delete workflow runs<br>b. Get the JSON log file |

### Example 2 - Workflow (Irreversible delete)
```yml
name: delete-github-workflow-runs

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '30 17 * * *'

permissions:
  actions: read
  contents: read

jobs:
  delete-workflow-runs:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    permissions:
      actions: write
      contents: read

    - id: delete-workflow-runs
      uses: tagdots/delete-workflow-runs@6384f56e65ab6e4e2e7193b3cffd3aae93b4636a # 1.1.18
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      with:
        repo-url: ${{ github.repository }}
        max-days: 10
        dry-run: false

    - name: Get data
      id: get_data
      shell: bash
      run: |
        # get data from the last step
        cat data_dict.log | jq .
```

<br>

## 🖥 Running _delete-workflow-runs_ from command line

### Prerequisites
```
* Python (3.12+)
* GitHub fine-grained token (actions: write, contents: read)
```

<br>

### Setup _delete-workflow-runs_
```
~/work/test $ workon test
(test) ~/work/test $ export GH_TOKEN=github_pat_xxxxxxxxxxxxx
(test) ~/work/test $ pip install -U delete-workflow-runs
```

<br>

### Example 1 - Run for help
```
(test) ~/work/test $ delete-workflow-runs --help
Usage: delete-workflow-runs [OPTIONS]

Options:
  --dry-run BOOLEAN   (optional) default: true
  --repo-url TEXT     e.g. https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}  [required]
  --min-runs INTEGER  (optional) min. no. of runs to keep in a workflow

## ⚠️ Summary of GitHub rate limit for standard repository
```
* 1,000 requests per hour per repository.
* No more than 100 concurrent requests are allowed.
* No more than 900 points per minute are allowed for REST API endpoints.
* No more than 90 seconds of CPU time per 60 seconds of real time is allowed.
* Make too many requests that consume excessive compute resources in a short period of time.
```

<br>

## ✍️ Notes
1. We don't present the starting and ending numbers of the API rate limit.  Based on our pioneer user feedbacks, other tasks could be running and consuming the API rate limit in parallel, which renders the numbers with mixed results.

1. We take a conservative approach and use only one worker thread, adding a 0.5-second delay after each delete to protect you from rate limit issues.  In the screenshot below, we used 16.5 minutes to delete 626 active workflow runs.  If not for the rate limit concern, we could have got it down to less than 5 minutes.
