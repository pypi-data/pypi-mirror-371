# Pycroner

**Pycroner** is a lightweight cron style job runner implemented in Python.
Jobs are configured via a YAML file and executed by the runner once their
cron schedule matches the current time.

While this Python package is easy to install and get started with, I am also actively developing its Rust counterpart [croner](https://github.com/AcidBurnHen/croner). I continuously share ideas and improvements between the two, bringing new features from PyCroner into Croner and applying Rust-inspired optimizations to make the Python version faster. I do not plan on dropping support for either project. My goal is to keep them in feature parity and evolving side by side.

## Why Pycroner?

This started as a tool I built for myself.

I was working on a system that had to run both on **Windows and Linux**, and keeping `cron` jobs in sync with **Windows Task Scheduler** was a constant headache. I wanted something dead simple, predictable, and cross-platform. 

And I didn’t want to write the same job schedules twice in two different formats.

So I built **Pycroner**.

It runs scheduled jobs from a single **YAML file**, no matter what OS you’re on. You just write your jobs once and they work everywhere.

Along the way, I added a few extra things:
- **Fanout support** — Run the same job multiple times with different args or in parallel.
- **Hot reload** — Update your config and it just picks it up live.
- **Hooks** — Jobs can run with specific scheduling hooks that are not possible with regular cron patterns, like on_start and on_exit. 
- **Multi-schedule configs** - You can define multiple schedules per config and they will be merged as one unified set of rules for the job, hook and cron jobs don't get merged, but still work together. 

If you're building automation or ETL flows, or just want a sane way to run time-based jobs in a Python project, this might save you from the time and pain I went through managing a project on both Windows and Linux.

## Features
- Parses standard five field cron expressions (minute, hour, day, month, weekday)
  using a small built in parser.
- Jobs can optionally be *fanned out* into multiple processes. Fanout may be an
  integer (repeat the job N times) or a list of argument strings that will be
  appended to the base command.
- Configuration lives in `pycroner.yml` by default. The exact format is
  described in [`pycroner/spec.md`](pycroner/spec.md).

## Installation

From PyPI:

```bash
pip install pycroner
```

## Usage
### From code 
1. Create a `pycroner.yml` file describing your jobs. A simple example is shown
   below.
2. Run the job runner from a Python script:

```python
from pycroner.runner import Runner

Runner("pycroner.yml").run()
```

The runner checks schedules every minute and spawns each job as a subprocess
when its cron expression matches the current time.

### From CLI
You can also invoke the runner directly from the command line using the
`pycroner` command. By default it looks for `pycroner.yml` in the current
directory:

```bash
pycroner
```

Specify an alternative working directory with `--at` or a specific
configuration file with `--config`:

```bash
pycroner --at /path/to/project
pycroner --config custom.yml
```

## Example Configuration
```yaml
jobs:
  - id: "index_articles"
    schedule: "*/15 * * * *"
    command: "python index.py"
    fanout: 4

  - id: "daily_etl"
    schedule: "0 2 * * *"
    command: "python etl.py"
    fanout:
      - "--source=internal --mode=full"
      - "--source=external --mode=delta"

  - id: "ping"
    schedule: "* * * * *"
    command: "python ping.py"

  - id: "startup"
    schedule: "on_start"
    command: "python startup.py"

  - id: "cleanup"
    schedule: "on_exit"
    command: "python cleanup.py"

  - id: "multi-conf-job"
    schedule: 
      - "on_start"
      - "*/2 * * * *"
      - "*/3 * * * *"
    command: "echo 'Hello usefulness'" 
```

Jobs run independently, and any output or error handling is left to your
commands. For full details see [`pycroner/spec.md`](pycroner/spec.md).

If the configuration file changes while the runner is active, it will be
reloaded automatically so updates take effect without restarting.

Output from each job is streamed with a colored prefix containing the job id, and if fanned out, the fanout numeric id is attached.


##  Hooks 
Hooks allow specific schedule executions that are not possible with regular cron expressions 

List of available hooks: 
- on_start 
- on_exit 

More hooks are being considered, and if you find a use case for a new hook you may open a PR or a discussion. 

###  Startup and Shutdown Hooks

Jobs scheduled with `on_start` run once immediately when the runner boots. 

Jobs scheduled with `on_exit` run once when the process is shutting down. The runner registers handlers for `SIGINT` and `SIGTERM` and also uses `atexit` to ensure shutdown hooks are executed on normal program termination.
