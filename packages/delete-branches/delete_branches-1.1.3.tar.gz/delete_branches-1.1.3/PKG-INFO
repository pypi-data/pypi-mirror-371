## ‚úÖ What does delete-branches do?
**delete-branches** deletes idle branches in GitHub repository.

_**exemptions**_: `default branch`, `protected branches`, `head branches in PR`, and `user-specified exclude branches`

<br>

## ‚≠ê Why switch to delete-branches?
- we reduce your supply chain risks with [openssf best practices](https://best.openssf.org) in our SDLC and operations.
- we share evidence of code coverage results in action (click _Code Coverage ¬ª cron-tasks ¬ª badge-coverage_).
- we can run using [command line](https://github.com/tagdots/delete-branches?tab=readme-ov-file#-running-delete-branches-from-command-line) or GitHub Action [Delete GitHub Branches](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/delete-github-branches).

## üèÉ Running _delete-branches_ in GitHub action
Use the workflow examples below to create your own workflow inside `.github/workflows/`.

| Input | Workflow Spec | Notes
|-------|-------------|----------|
| `scheduled run` | `- cron: '30 17 * * *'` | Run daily at 5:30 pm UTC
| `github token permissions` | `contents: read`<br>`pull-requests: read` | MOCK delete requires read permission |
| `dry-run` | `true` | MOCK delete |
| `exclude-branches` | `badges` | Branch `badges` is found and excluded |
| `max-idle-days` | `10` | Without new commits longer than 10 days |

### Example 1 - Workflow (MOCK delete)
```yml
