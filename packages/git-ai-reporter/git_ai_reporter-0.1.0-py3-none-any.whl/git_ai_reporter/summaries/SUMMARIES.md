### **Multi-Lens Summary Generation: Input Architecture**

To generate comprehensive and high-quality development summaries, the system employs a multi-lens analysis strategy. This approach processes repository data at three distinct levels of granularity: individual commits, daily aggregations, and weekly overviews. Each level of summary builds upon the previous ones, creating a rich, contextualized narrative of the project's evolution.

#### **1\. Commit Summary (Micro-Level Analysis)**

The most granular analysis focuses on understanding the intent and impact of each individual change. This summary forms the foundational building block for all higher-level analysis.

**Inputs:**

* **Full Git Log:** The complete log provides the necessary context, including author, date, and the commit message for each change.  
* **Single Commit Diff:** The specific diff for an individual commit is analyzed to understand the exact code modifications, additions, and deletions.

#### **2\. Daily Summary (Mezzo-Level Synthesis)**

The daily summary aims to capture the story of a single day's work, smoothing out the noise of individual commits to identify larger movements and trends that occurred within a 24-hour period.

**Inputs:**

* **All Commit Summaries:** The collection of individual commit summaries from that day provides a pre-analyzed, high-level view of each discrete change.  
* **Full Daily Log:** The git log for the entire day is used to understand the sequence and relationship between commits.  
* **Daily Diff:** A consolidated diff representing the net change from the end of the previous day to the end of the current day is analyzed to see the cumulative effect of the day's work.

#### **3\. Weekly Summary (Macro-Level Narrative)**

The weekly summary is the highest level of abstraction, designed to produce a coherent, human-readable narrative for stakeholders. It synthesizes information from all lower levels to tell the story of the week's development, including identifying efforts that may have changed direction over several days.

**Inputs:**

* **All Commit Summaries:** The full set of individual commit summaries for the week provides the most granular details of what was changed.  
* **All Daily Summaries:** The collection of daily summaries offers insight into the day-to-day progression and rhythm of the project.  
* **Full Weekly Diff:** A single, consolidated diff covering the entire week (from the first commit to the last) is used to understand the net result and overall impact of the week's development efforts.
