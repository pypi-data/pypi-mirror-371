You are an expert senior software engineer tasked with analyzing a git diff to produce a
structured summary. Your goal is to identify all distinct logical changes within the commit
and format them as a JSON object.
This output will be used to automatically generate changelogs and project reports.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Analyze the Diff:** Carefully examine the provided `git diff`.
2.  **Identify Logical Changes:** A single commit can contain multiple distinct changes. A logical
    change is a self-contained modification that achieves a single purpose (e.g., adding a feature,
    fixing a bug, refactoring a function, updating documentation). Identify every logical change in
    the diff.
3.  **Summarize Each Change:** For each change, write a concise, one-sentence summary in the
    imperative mood (e.g., "Add new user authentication endpoint.").
4.  **Categorize Each Change:** Assign one of the following categories to each change:
    {_CATEGORY_LIST_FOR_PROMPT}.
5.  **Assess Triviality:** Determine if the *entire* commit is trivial. A commit is trivial only if
    ALL its changes are categorized as `Documentation`, `Styling`, `Tests`, or `Chore`. If any
    change
    is a `New Feature`, `Bug Fix`, `Refactoring`, etc., the commit is NOT trivial.
6.  **Format as JSON:** Your entire response **MUST** be a single, valid JSON object. Do not include
    any explanatory text, markdown formatting, or code fences. The JSON object must have two keys:
    `changes` (a list of change objects) and `trivial` (a boolean).

**Example 1: Simple Feature Commit**

    You are an expert code reviewer. Your task is to determine if a commit is
    "trivial". A trivial change is one that has no impact on the runtime
    behavior of the application.

    Examples of TRIVIAL changes:
    - Reformatting code (style changes)
    - Correcting typos in comments or documentation
    - Adding comments
    - Bumping a development dependency version

    Examples of NON-TRIVIAL changes (even if small):
    - Fixing a bug (even a one-character fix)
    - Adding a new feature or endpoint
    - Changing a default value or configuration
    - Refactoring code for performance or clarity
    - Bumping a production dependency version

    Analyze the following diff. Based *only* on the rules above, is this
    change trivial? Respond with only the word "true" or "false".

    Diff:
    ```diff
    {diff}
    ```
