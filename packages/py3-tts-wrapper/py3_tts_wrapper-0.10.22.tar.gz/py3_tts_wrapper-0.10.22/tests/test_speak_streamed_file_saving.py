"""
Test speak_streamed method with file saving functionality.

This test specifically verifies that speak_streamed properly saves audio files
with correct WAV headers when save_to_file_path parameter is provided.

This addresses the bug where SherpaOnnx speak_streamed was saving raw PCM data
without proper WAV headers, causing "file does not start with RIFF id" errors.
