# Introduction

Welcome to TTS Wrapper, a powerful and flexible **python** library that simplifies text-to-speech integration across multiple services. Whether you're building an application that needs speech synthesis capabilities or just want to experiment with different TTS engines, TTS Wrapper provides a unified interface that makes it easy to work with various text-to-speech services.

## What is TTS Wrapper?

TTS Wrapper is a Python library that abstracts away the complexities of working with different text-to-speech APIs by providing:

- A unified interface for multiple TTS services
- Consistent handling of voice selection and audio properties
- Streamlined audio playback controls
- Cross-platform support
- Comprehensive SSML support where available

## Supported Engines

TTS Wrapper supports a wide range of both cloud-based and local TTS engines:

### Cloud Services
- AWS Polly
- Google Cloud TTS
- Microsoft Azure TTS
- IBM Watson
- ElevenLabs
- Wit.Ai
- Play.HT

### Local Engines
- eSpeak-NG (Linux/macOS/Windows)
