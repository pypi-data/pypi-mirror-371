| Command  | What they do                    |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| PLOT     | Turn on a pixel on the screen   |
| CLEAR    | Clear the screen                |

# Problems
| Item     | Problem                                                                                        |
|----------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| TEXT     | Only works if the height of your display is 5, you can get around this bug by using REALSIZE   |

# Notes
| Item         | Problem                                     |
|--------------|---------------------------------------------|
| REALSIZE     | Can lag since division is used every PLOT   |

# TODO
| What I need to do                                            |
|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Make a intermediate layer of compiling so the conpiled code will be correct and won't be changed by runtime stuff |
| Make plot be able to batch |
| Use a local echo to know if a point is already drawn |
| Use one letter for each command |
