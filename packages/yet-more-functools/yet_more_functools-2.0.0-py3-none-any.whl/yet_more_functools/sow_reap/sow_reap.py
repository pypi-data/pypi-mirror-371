    Calls to sow work in conjunction with "reap" or "reaper". Together they allow intermediate values to be returned
    from arbitrarily deep in the call hierarchy of a function without requiring any modification of the return
    signatures of the function(s) being called or any intermediates.

    Sow appends a value x onto collection for later delivery by a corresponding reap call somewhere higher up the call
    hierarchy, or alternatively it invokes a callback function on x.  The particular collection or callback used is
    identified by a hashable tag (defaults to None).  Each tag must be setup by a higher level, encapsulating call to
    reap.  Calls to reap may be nested inside calls to sow, even using the same tag.
