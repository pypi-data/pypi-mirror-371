    Catcher is a context manager which wraps around the execution of arbitrary code and catches the values 'thrown'
    by any calls to throw made inside the managed block.  It emits a callable which may be called after the block
    completes that carries any value thrown, as a 2-tuple: (tag, value), or None is nothing was thrown.

    catcher([tag=None])

    Example:

    .. code-block:: python

            print(f"The return value was {f(1)}.")
        print(f"The caught value was {ct()}")


    Will produce:
    .. code-block:: text

        The return value was 2.
