# Tutorials

Learn dotevals through hands-on tutorials that progress from basic concepts to production-ready evaluation pipelines.

## Learning Path

### Getting Started (Tutorials 1-3)
Start here if you're new to LLM evaluation or dotevals.

#### [1. Your First Evaluation](01-your-first-evaluation.md)
**Time: 15 minutes** ‚Ä¢ **Prerequisites: None**

Create your first evaluation in under 15 minutes. Learn the basic `@foreach` decorator and run a simple evaluation with real results.

**What you'll learn:**
- Basic evaluation structure with `@foreach`
- Running evaluations with pytest
- Viewing results with the CLI
- Understanding the evaluation lifecycle

---

#### [2. Using Real Models](02-using-real-models.md)
**Time: 20 minutes** ‚Ä¢ **Prerequisites: Tutorial 1**

Connect to actual LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) using pytest fixtures for efficient resource management.

**What you'll learn:**
- Pytest fixtures for model clients
- API key management and configuration
- Error handling for API calls
- Efficient resource pooling patterns

---

#### [3. Working with Real Datasets](03-working-with-real-datasets.md)
**Time: 25 minutes** ‚Ä¢ **Prerequisites: Tutorial 2**

Move beyond toy examples to evaluate on real datasets like GSM8K, MMLU, and custom data.

**What you'll learn:**
- Using dataset plugins (`dotevals-datasets`)
- Loading and processing evaluation datasets
- Dataset streaming for large evaluations
- Custom data format handling

---

### Intermediate Concepts (Tutorials 4-6)
Build deeper understanding of evaluation techniques and performance.

#### [4. Building Custom Evaluators](04-building-custom-evaluators.md)
**Time: 30 minutes** ‚Ä¢ **Prerequisites: Tutorial 3**

Create domain-specific evaluators for your use cases, from simple string matching to LLM-based judgments.

**What you'll learn:**
- Custom evaluator patterns with `@evaluator`
- Metrics and scoring systems
- LLM-as-a-judge evaluators
- Evaluator composition and reuse

---

#### [5. Scale with Async Evaluation](05-scale-with-async-evaluation.md)
**Time: 25 minutes** ‚Ä¢ **Prerequisites: Tutorial 4**

Speed up evaluations with asynchronous processing and concurrency control.

**What you'll learn:**
- Async evaluation functions
- Concurrency strategies and rate limiting
- Managing API quotas and throttling
- Performance optimization techniques

---

#### [6. Pytest Fixtures and Resource Pooling](06-pytest-fixtures-and-resource-pooling.md)
**Time: 20 minutes** ‚Ä¢ **Prerequisites: Tutorial 5**

Master advanced fixture patterns for efficient model management and resource sharing.

**What you'll learn:**
- Advanced fixture scoping and lifecycle
- Resource pooling for expensive models
- Parameterized fixtures for model comparison
- Testing patterns with evaluation functions

---

### Advanced Applications (Tutorials 7-8)
Production-ready patterns for serious evaluation workflows.

#### [7. Comparing Multiple Models](07-comparing-multiple-models.md)
**Time: 35 minutes** ‚Ä¢ **Prerequisites: Tutorial 6**

Systematically compare multiple models across different evaluation dimensions.

**What you'll learn:**
- Multi-model evaluation strategies
- Results aggregation and analysis
- Statistical significance testing
- Automated model comparison workflows

---

#### [8. Build Production Evaluation Pipeline](08-build-production-evaluation-pipeline.md)
**Time: 45 minutes** ‚Ä¢ **Prerequisites: Tutorial 7**

Build end-to-end evaluation pipelines with CI/CD integration and automated reporting.

**What you'll learn:**
- CI/CD integration patterns
- Automated evaluation workflows
- Results storage and retrieval
- Production monitoring and alerting

---
