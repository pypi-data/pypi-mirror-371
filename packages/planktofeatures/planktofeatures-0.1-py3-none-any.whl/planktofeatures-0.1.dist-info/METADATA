# planktofeatures
A Python library for calculating features of plankton images captured on the IFCB.

# Additional test dependencies
You will need libifcb to run the test script in addition to the other dependencies for planktofeatures.

# Acknowledgements
The WHOI V4 feature generation code is heavily derived from the [WHOI ifcb-features](https://github.com/WHOIGit/ifcb-features) program. It would not have been possible to create this library without the work of the WHOI team. The original WHOI ifcb-features code is MIT Licenced, and as such the MIT License applies to the whole whoi_v4 submodule.
