### What is VOPy?
VOPy is an open-source Python library built to address noisy black-box [vector optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_optimization) problems, where the user preferences are encoded with a cone order.

</p>

### What to do with VOPy?
VOPy includes several pre-implemented algorithms, models, orders, and problems from the literature for black-box vector optimization, allowing users to select and utilize components based on their specific needs. Specifically, you can:
- Use existing black-box vector optimization methods for new problems
- Benchmark novel algorithms with the state-of-the-art
- Utilize a wide range of existing tools in black-box vector optimization

### How To Start?

Visit our [**website**](https://vopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to see tutorials, examples and API references on how to use VOPy. We recommend starting out with the [**motivating example**](https://vopy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples/01_motivating_example.html).


### Setup

Installation using pip:
```bash
pip install vopy
```

#### Latest (Unstable) Version
To upgrade to the latest (unstable) version, run

```bash
pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/Bilkent-CYBORG/VOPy.git
```

#### Manual installation (for development)

If you are contributing a pull request, it is best to perform a manual installation:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Bilkent-CYBORG/VOPy.git
cd VOPy
mamba env create --name vopy --file environment.yml  # To setup a proper development environment
pip install -e .
```

For all development requirements, see [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) or [environment.yml](environment.yml).

Further, installing the pre-commit hooks are **highly** encouraged.

```sh
# Inside the package folder
pre-commit install
```
