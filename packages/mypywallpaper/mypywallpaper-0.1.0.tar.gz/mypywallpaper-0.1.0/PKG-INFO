## PyWallpaper: Change Wallpaper from Python 

PyWallpaper is a cross platform Python module to change wallpapers across different platforms.

The module uses ctypes and subprocess to work and the code is cross platform

## Installation

Use pip

```
pip install PyWallpaper
```

## Usage

There is a single function, change_wallpaper

Example:

```python
from PyWallpaper import change_wallpaper
change_wallpaper("C:/Users/Pradipta/Pictures/Misc/city.jpg")
```

You have to use `/` in place of `\` in Windows (or `\\`) because of Python restrictions

2. Linux support works only on GNOME, Unity and Cinnamon Desktops
