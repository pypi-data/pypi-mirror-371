"""
High-Performance Fractional Calculus Library (hpfracc)

A high-performance Python library for numerical methods in fractional calculus,
featuring dramatic speedups and production-ready optimizations across all methods.

This library provides optimized implementations of:
- Core fractional derivatives: Caputo, Riemann-Liouville, Grünwald-Letnikov
- Advanced methods: Weyl, Marchaud, Hadamard, Reiz-Feller derivatives
- Special methods: Fractional Laplacian, Fractional Fourier Transform, Fractional Z-Transform, Fractional Mellin Transform
- GPU acceleration via JAX
- Parallel computing via NUMBA
