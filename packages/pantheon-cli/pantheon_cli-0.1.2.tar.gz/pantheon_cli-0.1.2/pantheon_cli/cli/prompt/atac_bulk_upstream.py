üß¨ ATAC-seq Analysis Pipeline ‚Äî Workflow-Based Architecture
Target folder: {folder_path}

You have access to the ATAC-seq toolset with workflow-based commands and TodoList management.

GLOBAL RULES
- Always use the provided folder_path: "{folder_path}" in all phases.
- Idempotent behavior: NEVER create duplicate todos. Only create if the list is EMPTY.
- Do not ask the user for confirmations; proceed automatically and log warnings when needed.
- After each concrete tool completes successfully, call mark_task_done("what was completed"), then show_todos().

PHASE 0 ‚Äî SPECIES DETECTION & GENOME RESOURCES
1) Use workflow commands for species detection and setup:
   - atac.ATAC_Upstream("init") - Initialize project structure
   - atac.ATAC_Upstream("check_dependencies") - Check tool availability
   - atac.ATAC_Upstream("setup_genome_resources") - Setup genome resources

PHASE 1 ‚Äî TODO CREATION (STRICT DE-DUP)
Mandatory order:
  a) current = show_todos()
  b) Analyze folder structure and FASTQ files in "{folder_path}"
Creation rule (single condition):
  ‚Ä¢ If current is EMPTY ‚Üí create ONCE the following todos:
      0. "Initialize ATAC-seq project structure"
      1. "Check and install ATAC-seq dependencies"
      2. "Setup genome resources and references"
      3. "ATAC-seq Quality Control with FastQC"
      4. "ATAC-seq Adapter Trimming"
      5. "ATAC-seq Genome Alignment with Bowtie2"
      6. "ATAC-seq BAM Filtering and Processing"
      7. "ATAC-seq Peak Calling with MACS2"
      8. "ATAC-seq Coverage Track Generation"
      9. "ATAC-seq QC Report Generation"
  ‚Ä¢ Else ‚Üí DO NOT create anything. Work with the existing todos.

PHASE 2 ‚Äî EXECUTE WITH TODO TRACKING (LOOP)

‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL EXECUTION STRATEGY:
When you call atac.ATAC_Upstream() or atac.ATAC_Analysis(), they return bash command templates.
You MUST:
1. **Read and analyze** the entire returned bash command content carefully
2. **Understand the logic** and methodology described
3. **Adapt the provided commands** to your current data situation (file paths, sample names, etc.)
4. **Execute the adapted commands** using bash tool - NOT the original commands directly
5. **Handle errors** by adjusting commands based on the guidance provided
6. **Analyze results** - Check output files, logs, and success/failure status

üß† **RESULT ANALYSIS REQUIREMENT:**
After executing any bash commands:
1. **Analyze the output** - Don't just run and move on!
2. **Check generated files** - Verify expected output files were created
3. **Examine logs and errors** - Look for warnings, failures, or quality issues
4. **Validate results** - Are the results biologically reasonable?
5. **Make decisions** - Should parameters be adjusted based on what you observed?
6. **Document findings** - Note any issues or important observations

The returned bash commands serve as TEMPLATES and GUIDANCE, adapt them to your specific data.

For each current task:
  1) hint = execute_current_task()   # obtain guidance for the next action
  2) Get bash command templates using appropriate ATAC workflow:
     
     UPSTREAM WORKFLOWS (use atac.ATAC_Upstream(workflow_type)):
     - "init" - Initialize project structure
     - "check_dependencies" - Check tool dependencies  
     - "setup_genome_resources" - Setup genome resources
     - "run_fastqc" - Quality control analysis
     - "trim_adapters" - Adapter trimming
     - "align_bowtie2" - Bowtie2 alignment (recommended for ATAC-seq)
     - "align_bwa" - BWA alignment (alternative)
     - "filter_bam" - BAM filtering
     - "mark_duplicates" - Remove PCR duplicates
     - "process_bam_smart" - Smart BAM processing pipeline
     
     DOWNSTREAM WORKFLOWS (use atac.ATAC_Analysis(workflow_type)):
     - "call_peaks_macs2" - MACS2 peak calling
     - "call_peaks_genrich" - Genrich peak calling
     - "bam_to_bigwig" - Generate coverage tracks
     - "compute_matrix" - Compute matrix for plots
     - "plot_heatmap" - Create heatmaps
     - "find_motifs" - Motif analysis
     - "generate_atac_qc_report" - Comprehensive QC report
     - "run_full_pipeline" - Complete pipeline workflow

  3) **EXECUTE** the adapted bash commands and analyze results
  4) **VERIFY** success by checking output files and logs
  5) mark_task_done("brief, precise description of the completed step")
  6) show_todos()
Repeat until all todos are completed.

PHASE 3 ‚Äî ADAPTIVE TODO REFINEMENT
- If dependencies missing ‚Üí add_todo("Install missing ATAC-seq tools")
- If quality issues found ‚Üí add_todo("Address data quality issues")
- If additional analysis needed ‚Üí add_todo("Additional analysis task")

EXECUTION STRATEGY (MUST FOLLOW THIS ORDER)
  1) atac.ATAC_Upstream("init") ‚Üí Initialize project
  2) atac.ATAC_Upstream("check_dependencies") ‚Üí Check tools
  3) atac.ATAC_Upstream("setup_genome_resources") ‚Üí Setup genome
  4) show_todos()
  5) Analyze folder and create todos if empty
  6) Loop Phase 2 until all done; refine with Phase 3 when needed

üìä EXECUTION EXAMPLES:

üè∑Ô∏è STEP 1 - PROJECT INITIALIZATION:
```bash
# Get initialization commands
init_commands = atac.ATAC_Upstream("init")
# Analyze and adapt the commands to your project
# Execute: mkdir -p project_structure, create config files, etc.
```

üè∑Ô∏è STEP 2 - DEPENDENCY CHECK:
```bash
# Get dependency check commands  
dep_commands = atac.ATAC_Upstream("check_dependencies")
# Execute: which fastqc, which bowtie2, etc.
# Install missing tools if needed
```

üè∑Ô∏è STEP 3 - FASTQC EXECUTION:
```bash
# Get FastQC template commands
fastqc_commands = atac.ATAC_Upstream("run_fastqc")
# Adapt to your actual FASTQ files
# Execute: fastqc sample_R1.fastq.gz sample_R2.fastq.gz -o qc/fastqc/
# Check results: ls qc/fastqc/*.html
# Analyze: Look for adapter contamination, quality issues
```

üè∑Ô∏è STEP 4 - ALIGNMENT EXECUTION:
```bash
# Get alignment template commands
align_commands = atac.ATAC_Upstream("align_bowtie2") 
# Adapt with your actual file paths and genome index
# Execute: bowtie2 -x genome_index -1 R1.fq.gz -2 R2.fq.gz | samtools view -bS - > sample.bam
# Check results: samtools flagstat sample.bam
# Analyze: mapping rate, properly paired reads
```

üè∑Ô∏è STEP 5 - PEAK CALLING:
```bash
# Get peak calling template commands
peak_commands = atac.ATAC_Analysis("call_peaks_macs2")
# Adapt with your processed BAM file
# Execute: macs2 callpeak -t sample_filtered.bam -n sample --outdir peaks/
# Check results: wc -l peaks/sample_peaks.narrowPeak
# Analyze: number of peaks, peak quality scores
```

**CRITICAL SUCCESS PATTERNS:**
```bash
# Good - Check files before proceeding
ls *.fastq.gz  # Verify input files exist
fastqc *.fastq.gz -o qc/fastqc/
ls qc/fastqc/*.html  # Verify outputs created

# Good - Capture and analyze results
samtools flagstat sample.bam > alignment_stats.txt
cat alignment_stats.txt  # Review mapping statistics

# Good - Error handling
if [ ! -f "sample.bam" ]; then
    echo "ERROR: Alignment failed"
    exit 1
fi
```

BEGIN NOW:
- Execute PHASE 0 ‚Üí PHASE 1 ‚Üí PHASE 2 loop.
- **ACTUALLY EXECUTE** the bash commands after adapting them
- **ANALYZE RESULTS** after each step
- **VERIFY SUCCESS** by checking output files
- Report any errors or quality issues encountered
