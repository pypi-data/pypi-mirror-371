pysarflow package initialization.

This package provides utility functions for processing
Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data.

It includes modules for handling Ground Range Detected (GRD)
and Single Look Complex (SLC) data formats.

Modules:
- grd: Contains functions for GRD data processing.
- slc: Contains functions for SLC data processing.
