This project aims to act as a framework for any scale of botnet. Priority focuses are on security and simple management of clients. I was displeased with the lack of libraries purpose built for this subject, so I made one.



## Features
- Handle large quantities of clients asynchronously
- Security
  - [ ] End to end encryption
  - [ ] Tor routing
  - [ ] Proxy(ies) via cycling where applicable
  - [ ] VPN
  - [ ] More?
- Easy client control
  - Class based clients
  - Broadcast filters
  - Modular client features



## Installation
Installation may be done via pip.<br/>
**Developed in python 3.13**
```bash
# Linux
python3 -m pip install botnet
# Windows (if installed from python.org and not the windows store)
py -m pip install botnet
```
