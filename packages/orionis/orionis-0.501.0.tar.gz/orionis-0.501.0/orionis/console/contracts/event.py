        Retrieve the event details as an EventEntity instance.

        This method gathers all relevant attributes of the current Event object,
        such as its signature, arguments, purpose, random delay, start and end dates,
        and trigger, and returns them encapsulated in an EventEntity object.

        Returns

        Set the purpose or description for the scheduled command.

        This method assigns a human-readable purpose or description to the command
        that is being scheduled. The purpose must be a non-empty string. This can
        be useful for documentation, logging, or displaying information about the
        scheduled job.

        Parameters
        ----------
        purpose : str
            The purpose or description to associate with the scheduled command.

        Parameters
        ----------

        distributing load or avoiding collisions in scheduled tasks.

        Schedule the event to run at fixed intervals measured in seconds.

        This method configures the event to execute repeatedly at a specified interval
        (in seconds). Optionally, the event can be restricted to a time window using
        previously set start and end dates. A random delay (jitter) can also be applied
