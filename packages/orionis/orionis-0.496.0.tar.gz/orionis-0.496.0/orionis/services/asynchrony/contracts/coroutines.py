        T or asyncio.Future
            If called outside of an event loop, returns the result of the coroutine execution (type T).
            If called within an event loop, returns an asyncio.Future representing the scheduled coroutine.

        Notes
        -----
        - Executes the coroutine synchronously and returns its result when called outside an event loop.
        - Schedules the coroutine for asynchronous execution and returns a Future when called inside an event loop.
        - The caller is responsible for awaiting the Future if asynchronous execution is used.
