        Parameters
        ----------
        schedule : ISchedule
            The schedule object used to define and register scheduled commands. 
            This object provides methods to add tasks to the scheduler.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It is intended to be overridden
            by subclasses to specify scheduled tasks.

        Notes
        -----
        This method serves as a contract for subclasses to implement task registration
        logic. Subclasses should use the provided `schedule` object to define and
        register tasks that the scheduler will execute.

            This method does not return any value.

        Notes
        -----
        Subclasses should override this method to implement custom behavior that
        should occur when the scheduler starts running. This can include initializing
        resources or logging the start event.

        Notes
        -----
        Subclasses should override this method to define custom behavior that occurs

        -----
        Subclasses should override this method to implement any actions that need to

            This method does not return any value.

        Notes
        -----
        Subclasses can override this method to perform any necessary cleanup or
        finalization tasks, such as releasing resources or logging the finalization

            The exception instance representing the error that occurred.

        Subclasses can override this method to implement custom error handling logic
