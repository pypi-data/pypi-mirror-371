        Register a listener callback for a specific scheduler event.

        This method allows the registration of a callable listener function that will be
        invoked when the specified scheduler event occurs. The event can be one of the
        predefined global events or a specific job ID. The listener must be a callable
        function that accepts a single argument, which will be the event object.

        Parameters
        ----------
        event : str
            The name of the event to listen for. This can be a global event name (e.g., 'scheduler_started')
            or a specific job ID.
        listener : callable
            A callable function that will be invoked when the specified event occurs.
            The function should accept one parameter, which will be the event object.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It registers the listener for the specified event.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the event name is not a non-empty string or if the listener is not callable.

        Prepare an Event instance for a given command signature and its arguments.

        This method validates the provided command signature and arguments, ensuring
        that the command exists among the registered commands and that the arguments
        are in the correct format. If validation passes, it creates and returns an
        Event object representing the scheduled command, including its signature,
        arguments, and description.

        Parameters
        ----------
        signature : str
            The unique signature identifying the command to be scheduled. Must be a non-empty string.
        args : Optional[List[str]], optional
            A list of string arguments to be passed to the command. Defaults to None.

        Returns
        -------
        Event
            An Event instance containing the command signature, arguments, and its description.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If the command signature is not a non-empty string, if the arguments are not a list
            of strings or None, or if the command does not exist among the registered commands.

        Start the AsyncIO scheduler instance and keep it running.

        This method initiates the AsyncIOScheduler which integrates with asyncio event loops
        for asynchronous job execution. It ensures the scheduler starts properly within
        an asyncio context and maintains the event loop active to process scheduled jobs.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It starts the AsyncIO scheduler and keeps it running.

        Shut down the AsyncIO scheduler instance asynchronously.

        This method gracefully stops the AsyncIOScheduler that handles asynchronous job execution.
        Using async ensures proper cleanup in asyncio environments.

        Parameters
        ----------
        wait : bool, optional
            If True, the method will wait until all currently executing jobs are completed before shutting down the scheduler.
            If False, the scheduler will be shut down immediately without waiting for running jobs to finish. Default is True.

        Returns
        -------
        None
            This method does not return any value. It shuts down the AsyncIO scheduler.

        Remove a scheduled job from the AsyncIO scheduler asynchronously.

        This method removes a job with the specified signature from both the internal
        jobs dictionary and the AsyncIOScheduler instance. Using async ensures proper
        cleanup in asyncio environments.

        Parameters
        ----------
        signature : str
            The signature of the command/job to remove from the scheduler.

        Returns
        -------
        bool
            Returns True if the job was successfully removed, False if the job was not found.

        signature, arguments, purpose, random delay, start and end dates, and additional job details.
