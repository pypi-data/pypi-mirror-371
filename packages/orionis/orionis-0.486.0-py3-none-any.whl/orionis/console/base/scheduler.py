        ----------
        schedule : ISchedule
            The schedule object used to define and register scheduled commands.

            This method does not return any value. It is intended to be overridden
            by subclasses to specify scheduled tasks.

        Notes
        -----
        This method should be implemented in subclasses to add specific tasks
        to the scheduler using the provided `schedule` object.
