    A playing card with rank and suit.

    Attributes:
        key (int): Unique bitmask identifier for the card (power of 2).
        rank (Rank): The rank of the card (e.g., Ace, King, 2, 3, etc.).
        suit (Suit): The suit of the card (Clubs, Diamonds, Hearts, Spades).
        code (str): Two-character code representing the card (e.g., 'AS' for Ace of Spades).
        name (str): Full name of the card (e.g., 'Ace of Spades').
        symbol (str): Unicode symbol representation of the card (e.g., 'A♠').

    Example:
