- Python 3.7 or higher
- Git
- Firefox browser (for testing)

### Setup Steps

1. **Fork and clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/firefox-tab-extractor.git
   cd firefox-tab-extractor
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install development dependencies**

   pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

4. **Install pre-commit hooks**
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run tests with coverage
pytest --cov=firefox_tab_extractor

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_extractor.py

# Run tests with verbose output
pytest -v
```

### Code Quality Tools

```bash
# Format code with Black
black firefox_tab_extractor/

# Check code style with flake8
flake8 firefox_tab_extractor/

# Type checking with mypy
mypy firefox_tab_extractor/
```

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
- Use Black for code formatting (line length: 88 characters)
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for all public functions and classes

### Example Code Style

```python
from typing import List, Optional, Dict, Any
from datetime import datetime


def extract_tabs_from_session(session_data: Dict[str, Any]) -> List[Tab]:
    """
    Extract tab information from Firefox session data.
    
    Args:
        session_data: Parsed session data from Firefox
        
    Returns:
        List of Tab objects
        
    Raises:
        SessionDataError: If session data is invalid
    """
    tabs: List[Tab] = []
    
    if 'windows' not in session_data:
        raise SessionDataError("No windows found in session data")
    
    # ... implementation ...
    
    return tabs
```

### Commit Message Guidelines

Use conventional commit messages:

- `feat:` for new features
- `fix:` for bug fixes
- `docs:` for documentation changes
- `style:` for code style changes
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `test:` for adding or updating tests
- `chore:` for maintenance tasks

Example:
```
feat: add support for Chrome browser tabs

- Add ChromeTabExtractor class
- Implement Chrome profile detection
- Add tests for Chrome functionality
- Update documentation with Chrome examples

Closes #123
```
