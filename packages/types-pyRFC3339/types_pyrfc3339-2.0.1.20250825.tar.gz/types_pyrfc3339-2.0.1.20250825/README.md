## Typing stubs for pyRFC3339

This is a [type stub package](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/external_libraries.html)
for the [`pyRFC3339`](https://github.com/kurtraschke/pyRFC3339) package. It can be used by type checkers
to check code that uses `pyRFC3339`. This version of
`types-pyRFC3339` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`pyRFC3339~=2.0.1`.

since version 2.1.0. Please uninstall the `types-pyRFC3339`
package if you use this or a newer version.
