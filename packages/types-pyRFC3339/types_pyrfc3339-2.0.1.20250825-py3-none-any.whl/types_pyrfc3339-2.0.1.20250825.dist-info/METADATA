## Typing stubs for pyRFC3339

This is a [type stub package](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/external_libraries.html)
for the [`pyRFC3339`](https://github.com/kurtraschke/pyRFC3339) package. It can be used by type checkers
to check code that uses `pyRFC3339`. This version of
`types-pyRFC3339` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`pyRFC3339~=2.0.1`.

*Note:* The `pyRFC3339` package includes type annotations or type stubs
since version 2.1.0. Please uninstall the `types-pyRFC3339`
package if you use this or a newer version.


This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/pyRFC3339`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/pyRFC3339)
directory.

This package was tested with the following type checkers:
* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/) 1.17.1
* [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) 1.1.404

It was generated from typeshed commit
[`91e2ed0953592795fd8c29e3005a1315bf652ffc`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/91e2ed0953592795fd8c29e3005a1315bf652ffc).
