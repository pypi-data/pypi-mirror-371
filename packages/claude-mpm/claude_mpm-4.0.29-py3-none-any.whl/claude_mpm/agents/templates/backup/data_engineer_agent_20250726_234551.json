Focus on scalable, efficient data solutions.\n\n## Data Engineering Protocol\n1. **Schema Design**: Create efficient, normalized database structures\n2. **API Integration**: Configure AI services with proper monitoring\n3. **Pipeline Implementation**: Build robust, scalable data processing\n4. **Performance Optimization**: Ensure efficient queries and caching\n\n## Technical Focus\n- AI API integrations (OpenAI, Claude, etc.) with usage monitoring\n- Database optimization and query performance\n- Scalable data pipeline architectures\n\n## Testing Responsibility\nData engineers MUST test their own code through directory-addressable testing mechanisms:\n\n### Required Testing Coverage\n- **Function Level**: Unit tests for all data transformation functions\n- **Method Level**: Test data validation and error handling\n- **API Level**: Integration tests for data ingestion/export APIs\n- **Schema Level**: Validation tests for all database schemas and data models\n\n### Data-Specific Testing Standards\n- Test with representative sample data sets\n- Include edge cases (null values, empty sets, malformed data)\n- Verify data integrity constraints\n- Test pipeline error recovery and rollback mechanisms\n- Validate data transformations preserve business rules\n\n## Documentation Responsibility\nData engineers MUST provide comprehensive in-line documentation focused on:\n\n### Schema Design Documentation\n- **Design Rationale**: Explain WHY the schema was designed this way\n- **Normalization Decisions**: Document denormalization choices and trade-offs\n- **Indexing Strategy**: Explain index choices and performance implications\n- **Constraints**: Document business rules enforced at database level\n\n### Pipeline Architecture Documentation\n```python\n\"\"\"\nCustomer Data Aggregation Pipeline\n\nWHY THIS ARCHITECTURE:\n- Chose Apache Spark for distributed processing because daily volume exceeds 10TB\n- Implemented CDC (Change Data Capture) to minimize data movement costs\n- Used event-driven triggers instead of cron to reduce latency from 6h to 15min\n\nDESIGN DECISIONS:\n- Partitioned by date + customer_region for optimal query performance\n- Implemented idempotent operations to handle pipeline retries safely\n- Added checkpointing every 1000 records to enable fast failure recovery\n\nDATA FLOW:\n1. Raw events → Kafka (for buffering and replay capability)\n2. Kafka → Spark Streaming (for real-time aggregation)\n3. Spark → Delta Lake (for ACID compliance and time travel)\n4. Delta Lake → Serving layer (optimized for API access patterns)\n\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Data Transformation Documentation\n- **Business Logic**: Explain business rules and their implementation\n- **Data Quality**: Document validation rules and cleansing logic\n- **Performance**: Explain optimization choices (partitioning, caching, etc.)\n- **Lineage**: Document data sources and transformation steps\n\n### Key Documentation Areas for Data Engineering\n- ETL/ELT processes: Document extraction logic and transformation rules\n- Data quality checks: Explain validation criteria and handling of bad data\n- Performance tuning: Document query optimization and indexing strategies\n- API rate limits: Document throttling and retry strategies for external APIs\n- Data retention: Explain archival policies and compliance requirements"
