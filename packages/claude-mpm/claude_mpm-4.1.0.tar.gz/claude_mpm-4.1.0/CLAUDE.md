## Development Guidelines

### Critical Principles

**🔴 NEVER ASSUME - ALWAYS VERIFY**
- **NEVER assume** file locations, configurations, or implementations
- **ALWAYS verify** by reading actual files and checking current state
- **ALWAYS check** existing code patterns before implementing
- **NEVER guess** at directory structures or file contents
- **ALWAYS confirm** dependencies and imports exist before using them

### Project Structure Requirements

1. **File Organization**: Always refer to `docs/STRUCTURE.md` when creating new files
   - **Scripts**: ALL scripts go in `/scripts/`, NEVER in project root
   - **Tests**: ALL tests go in `/tests/`, NEVER in project root
   - **Python modules**: Always under `/src/claude_mpm/`
   
2. **Import Conventions**: 
   - Use full package names: `from claude_mpm.module import ...`
   - Never use relative imports in main code
   - Check existing patterns before adding new imports

### Testing Requirements

**After significant changes, always run:**
```bash
# Quick E2E tests
./scripts/run_e2e_tests.sh

# Full test suite
./scripts/run_all_tests.sh

# Lint and type checks (catches duplicate imports!)
./scripts/run_lint.sh
```

See [docs/QA.md](docs/QA.md) for detailed testing procedures.
See [docs/LINTING.md](docs/LINTING.md) for linting configuration and duplicate import detection.

### Key System Components

When modifying the codebase, understand these core systems:

1. **Framework Loader** (`src/claude_mpm/core/framework_loader.py`)
   - Loads PM instructions from `src/claude_mpm/agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md`
   - Manages agent discovery and capabilities
   - DO NOT duplicate CLAUDE.md content here

2. **Hook System** (`src/claude_mpm/hooks/`)
   - Extensibility through pre/post hooks
   - Response logging via `SubagentStop` and `Stop` events
   - Structured JSON responses for proper logging

3. **Services Layer** (`src/claude_mpm/services/`)
   - **Core Services**: Foundation interfaces and base classes
   - **Agent Services**: Agent lifecycle, deployment, and management
   - **Communication Services**: Real-time WebSocket and SocketIO
   - **Project Services**: Project analysis and workspace management
   - **Infrastructure Services**: Logging, monitoring, and error handling
   - **Legacy Structure**: Maintained for backward compatibility

4. **CLI System** (`src/claude_mpm/cli/`)
   - Modular command structure
   - See [CLI Architecture](src/claude_mpm/cli/README.md) for adding new commands

### Common Development Tasks

#### Adding a New Service
1. **Create Interface**: Define service contract in `src/claude_mpm/services/core/interfaces.py`
2. **Implement Service**: Create implementation in appropriate service domain
3. **Register Service**: Add to service container if using dependency injection
4. **Add Tests**: Create unit, integration, and interface compliance tests
5. **Update Documentation**: Document service in [docs/developer/SERVICES.md](docs/developer/SERVICES.md)

#### Service Development Patterns
```python
# 1. Define interface
class IMyService(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def my_operation(self, param: str) -> bool:
        pass

# 2. Implement service
class MyService(BaseService, IMyService):
    def __init__(self, dependency: IDependency):
        super().__init__("MyService")
        self.dependency = dependency
    
    async def initialize(self) -> bool:
        # Initialize service
        return True
    
    def my_operation(self, param: str) -> bool:
        # Implementation
        return True

# 3. Register in container
container.register(IMyService, MyService, singleton=True)

# 4. Test interface compliance
def test_service_implements_interface():
    service = MyService(mock_dependency)
    assert isinstance(service, IMyService)
```

#### Modifying PM Instructions
1. Edit `src/claude_mpm/agents/INSTRUCTIONS.md` for PM behavior
2. Edit `src/claude_mpm/agents/BASE_PM.md` for framework requirements
3. Test with `./claude-mpm run` in interactive mode
4. Update tests for PM behavior changes

#### Adding CLI Commands
1. Create command module in `src/claude_mpm/cli/commands/`
2. Register in `src/claude_mpm/cli/parser.py`
3. Follow existing command patterns
4. Use dependency injection for service access
5. Add comprehensive tests and documentation

#### Performance Optimization
1. **Identify Bottlenecks**: Use profiling tools and performance tests
2. **Implement Caching**: Add appropriate caching layers
3. **Lazy Loading**: Defer expensive operations until needed
4. **Connection Pooling**: Reuse expensive connections
5. **Monitor Metrics**: Track performance over time

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Architecture-Related Issues
1. **Service Resolution Errors**: Ensure services are registered in container before resolving
2. **Interface Compliance**: Verify services implement all required interface methods
3. **Circular Dependencies**: Use dependency injection and avoid circular imports
4. **Cache Performance**: Monitor cache hit rates and adjust TTL settings

### Legacy Compatibility Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Use new service paths or rely on lazy import compatibility
2. **Service Instantiation**: Use service container instead of direct instantiation
3. **Configuration Schema**: Update config files to new structure

### Performance Issues
1. **Slow Startup**: Check lazy loading implementation and cache warming
2. **Memory Usage**: Monitor service memory consumption and optimization
3. **Cache Misses**: Verify cache configuration and invalidation strategies

### Traditional Issues
1. **Import Errors**: Ensure virtual environment is activated and PYTHONPATH includes `src/`
2. **Hook Service Errors**: Check port availability (8765-8785)
3. **Version Errors**: Run `pip install -e .` to ensure proper installation
4. **Agent Deployment**: All agents now deploy to project-level `.claude/agents/` directory (changed in v4.0.32+)

### Version Management

Claude MPM uses a dual tracking system as of v4.0.25:
- **VERSION file**: Contains semantic version only (e.g., "3.9.5")
- **BUILD_NUMBER file**: Contains serial build number only (e.g., "275")
- **Combined display**: Three formats for different contexts:
  - Development: `3.9.5+build.275` (PEP 440 compliant)
  - UI/Logging: `v3.9.5-build.275` (user-friendly)
  - PyPI Release: `3.9.5` (clean semantic version)

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for automatic versioning:
- `feat:` for new features (minor version bump)
- `fix:` for bug fixes (patch version bump)
- `feat!:` or `BREAKING CHANGE:` for breaking changes (major version bump)
- `perf:` for performance improvements
- `refactor:` for code refactoring
- `docs:` for documentation updates

Build numbers increment automatically with every substantial code change via git hooks.

## Deployment Process

See [docs/DEPLOY.md](docs/DEPLOY.md) for the complete deployment process:
- Version management with `./scripts/manage_version.py`
- Building and publishing to PyPI
- Creating GitHub releases
- Post-deployment verification
