# Exabel Python SDK

A Python SDK which provides easy access to Exabel APIs.

## Installation

```shell
pip install exabel-data-sdk
```

or download from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/exabel-data-sdk/).

The SDK requires Python 3.9 or later.

### Installation with SQL data source support

For installation with support for exporting data from a various SQL based data sources, add the data source as a pip extra in brackets after the package name:

```shell
# Install the Exabel Python SDK with Snowflake support:
pip install exabel-data-sdk[snowflake]

# Or install multiple data sources at the same time:
pip install exabel-data-sdk[snowflake,bigquery,athena]
```

Supported data sources are:

* Snowflake: `snowflake`
* Google BigQuery: `bigquery`
* AWS Athena: `athena`

## Getting started

To use the SDK against the Data API, Analytics API or Management API, you need an API key provided by Exabel.

The Exabel Export API can be used by authenticating with username and password.
The first time you run the script a web browser window is opened where you are asked to provide username and password. The script stores an access token in ``~/.exabel``, so you will not be asked again
until the token expires.
