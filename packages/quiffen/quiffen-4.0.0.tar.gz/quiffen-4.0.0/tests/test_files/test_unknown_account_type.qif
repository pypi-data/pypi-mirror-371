# This is a strange file but it is representative of a real Quicken
# export. It's unclear what the purpose of the !Option section is.
# But it seems like non-standard account types are used in this section,
# even though when the account transactions appear, they use a standard
# type (Invst). Since the meaning is unclear we take the simplest
# approach. The first time !Account is encountered, that is where
# the account is defined. If the account type is unknown it will
# be identified as such. In this case, the transactions may be
# categorized under a different account type, which isn't ideal but
# the QIF standard seems to allow for this.
