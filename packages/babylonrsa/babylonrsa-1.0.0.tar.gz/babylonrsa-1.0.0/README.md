# BabylonRSA ðŸ”‘ðŸª”

**BabylonRSA** is a Python library for experimenting with public/private key encryption (RSA-like) using the **Babylonian sexagesimal (base-60) numeral system**.  
Instead of encoding numbers in decimal or hexadecimal, this library stores ciphertext and keys in **base-60**, inspired by ancient Mesopotamian mathematics.
