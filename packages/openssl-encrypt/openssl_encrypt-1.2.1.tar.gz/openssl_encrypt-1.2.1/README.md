## History
The project is historically named `openssl-encrypt` because it once was a python script wrapper around openssl. But that did not work anymore with recent python versions.
Therefore I decided to do a complete rewrite in pure python also using modern cipher and hashes. So the projectname is a "homage" to the root of all :-)

Whirlpool support: The whirlpool hash algorithm is now supported on all Python versions, including Python 3.11, 3.12, and 3.13. The package will automatically detect your Python version and install the appropriate
Whirlpool implementation.
