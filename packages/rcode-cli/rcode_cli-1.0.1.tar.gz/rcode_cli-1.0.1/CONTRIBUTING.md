## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Core Principles

1. **Context-Aware**: Use the context system for intelligent operations
2. **Checkpoint-Safe**: All operations should support undo/redo
3. **Human-Approved**: Dangerous operations require user confirmation
4. **Configuration-Driven**: Behavior controlled by config files
5. **Performance-First**: Optimize for speed and resource usage

### Component Structure
