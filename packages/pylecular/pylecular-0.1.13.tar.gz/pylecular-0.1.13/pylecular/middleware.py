"""
Middleware Module for the Pylecular framework.

This module defines the Middleware base class that provides hooks for intercepting and
modifying behavior at various stages of the Pylecular lifecycle. Middleware can be used
for logging, authentication, request/response transformation, error handling, and more.

Each middleware method provides a specific hook point in the broker or service lifecycle.

    Base Middleware class that can be extended to intercept and modify Pylecular behavior.

    Middleware classes can implement any of these methods to hook into the framework's lifecycle:

    Handler hooks (to intercept actions and events):
    - local_action: Called when a local action is being set up
    - remote_action: Called when a remote action is being set up
    - local_event: Called when a local event is being set up

    Broker lifecycle hooks:
    - broker_created: Called synchronously when the broker is created
    - broker_started: Called asynchronously when the broker is started
    - broker_stopped: Called asynchronously when the broker is stopped

    Service lifecycle hooks:
    - service_created: Called asynchronously when a service is registered
    - service_started: Called asynchronously when a service is started
    - service_stopped: Called asynchronously when a service is stopped
