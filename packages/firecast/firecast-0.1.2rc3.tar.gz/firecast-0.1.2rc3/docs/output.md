# FIRE Plan Simulator Outputs Overview

This document summarizes all user-facing outputs generated by the FIRE simulator.

---

## 1. Console Output

- **Simulation summary:**
  - Success rate (%), number of failed simulations.
  - If failures occurred: average months lasted in failed cases.
- **Final wealth statistics (for successful simulations):**
  - Median, 25th percentile, 75th percentile, and interquartile range for both nominal and real
    final wealth.
- **Key scenario details:**
  - For both nominal and real wealth:
    - Worst, median, and best successful cases (selected by respective wealth type).
    - For each case:
      - Final wealth (nominal and real)
      - Cumulative Inflation Factor
      - CAGR (nominal or real, as appropriate)
      - Final allocations (percentages and nominal values)

## 2. Markdown Report

- **Comprehensive summary:**
  - Mirrors the console output, but in Markdown format for easier sharing and archiving.
- **Final wealth distribution statistics:**
  - Table with median, 25th, 75th percentiles, and interquartile range for both nominal and real final wealth.
- **Key scenario details:**
  - For both nominal and real wealth:
    - Worst, median, and best successful cases (selected by respective wealth type).
    - For each case:
      - Final wealth (nominal and real)
      - Cumulative Inflation Factor
      - CAGR (nominal or real, as appropriate)
      - Final allocations (percentages and nominal values)
- **Visualizations:**
  - Embedded images/links to generated plots.
- **Loaded parameters:**
  - JSON block with all simulation parameters/configuration.
- **Metadata:**
  - Config file used and report generation date.

## 3. Plots (PNG/Images)

All plots are saved as PNG files in the output directory.  
**Note:** Some plots use a logarithmic (log) scale for better visualization of wide-ranging values.

- **wealth_evolution_samples_nominal.png**

  - ✅ Evolution of total wealth over time (nominal terms, log scale).

- **wealth_evolution_samples_real.png**

  - ✅ Evolution of total wealth over time (real/inflation-adjusted terms, log scale).

- **failed_wealth_evolution_samples_nominal.png**

  - ✅ Evolution of total wealth over time of failed simulations (nominal terms, log scale).

- **failed_wealth_evolution_samples_real.png**

  - ✅ Evolution of total wealth over time of failed simulations (real/inflation-adjusted terms, log scale).

- **bank_account_trajectories_nominal.png**

  - ✅ Bank account balances over time (nominal terms).

- **bank_account_trajectories_real.png**

  - ✅ Bank account balances over time (real/inflation-adjusted terms).

- **final_wealth_distribution_nominal.png**

  - ✅ Distribution of final total wealth across all simulations (nominal terms, may use log scale).

- **final_wealth_distribution_real.png**

  - ✅ Distribution of final total wealth across all simulations (real/inflation-adjusted terms, may
    use log scale).

- **failed_duration_distribution.png**

  - ✅ Distribution of durations (in months/years) for failed simulations.

- **Other visualizations:**
  - (Optional/future) Asset allocation over time, scenario comparisons, etc.

## 4. Data Files (Feature do add)

- **Raw results:**
  - (Planned) Export to CSV/Excel for further analysis.
- **Intermediate data:**
  - (Planned) Pickle or JSON files for debugging or reproducibility.

---

## 5. Logs (Feature do add)

- **Error and debug logs:**
  - (If enabled) Detailed logs for troubleshooting.
