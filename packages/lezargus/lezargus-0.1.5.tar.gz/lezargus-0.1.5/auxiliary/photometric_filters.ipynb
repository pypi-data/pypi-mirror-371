As stated by these authors, these curves *are designed to be integrated directly over stellar spectra in $F_\\lambda$ form, in order to calculate synthetic photometric magnitudes. The QE-based component was converted to yield photon-counting RSRs by multiplying by wavelength and renormalized, as described by [Bessel (2000)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2000PASP..112..961B/abstract).* As such, these filters are in the photon counting form so we need to convert it."
