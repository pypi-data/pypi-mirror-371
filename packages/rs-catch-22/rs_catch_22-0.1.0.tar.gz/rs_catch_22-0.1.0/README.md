# rs-catch-22 ü¶Ä

A high-performance Rust implementation of the catch22 time-series feature extraction library, offering **4.38x faster** computation compared to the original Python implementation.

## Overview

**rs-catch-22** is a Rust-based reimplementation of the canonical catch22 time-series feature set, originally developed as [pycatch22](https://github.com/DynamicsAndNeuralSystems/pycatch22). This package provides Python bindings for all 22 time-series features (plus optional mean and standard deviation for catch24) with significant performance improvements through Rust's zero-cost abstractions and parallel computation.

catch22 is a collection of 22 time-series features coded in C that can be run from Python, R, Matlab, and Julia. This Rust implementation maintains full compatibility with the original API while delivering substantial performance gains.

## Key Features

- ‚ö° **Massive Performance Gains**: 4.6x faster for individual features, up to 14.48x faster for batch processing
- ü¶Ä **Memory Safe**: Built with Rust's ownership system for guaranteed memory safety  
- üîÑ **Parallel Processing**: Leverages Rayon for concurrent feature computation across multiple time series
- üêç **Drop-in Replacement**: Identical API to pycatch22 with seamless integration
- üìä **Complete Feature Set**: All 22 canonical features + optional mean/std (catch24)
- üéØ **Optimized Dependencies**: Minimal external dependencies optimized for performance at compile time
- üî¢ **Batch Processing**: Highly optimized cumulative feature extraction for large datasets, seeing improvements of 14x

### Individual Features
