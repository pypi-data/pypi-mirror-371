``dantro``: handle, transform, and visualize hierarchically structured data
===========================================================================

``dantro`` – from *data* and *dentro* (Greek for *tree*) – is a Python
package that provides a uniform interface for hierarchically structured
and semantically heterogeneous data. It is built around three main
features:

-  **data handling:** loading heterogeneous data into a tree-like data
   structure, providing a uniform interface to it
-  **data transformation:** performing arbitrary operations on the data,
   if necessary using lazy evaluation
-  **data visualization:** creating a visual representation of the
   processed data

Together, these stages constitute a **data processing pipeline**: an
automated sequence of predefined, configurable operations. Akin to a
Continuous Integration pipeline, a data processing pipeline provides a
uniform, consistent, and easily extensible infrastructure that
contributes to more efficient and reproducible workflows. This can be
beneficial especially in a scientific context, for instance when
handling data that was generated by computer simulations.

``dantro`` is meant to be *integrated* into projects and be used to set up
such a data processing pipeline, customized to the needs of the project.
It is designed to be **easily customizable** to the requirements of the project
it is integrated in, even if the involved data is hierachically structured or
semantically heterogeneous.
Furthermore, it allows a **configuration-based specification** of all
operations via `YAML <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML>`_ configuration
files; the resulting pipeline can then be controlled entirely via these
configuration files and without requiring code changes.

The ``dantro`` package is **open source software** released under the
`LGPLv3+ <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.html>`_ license.
It was developed alongside the `Utopia project <https://gitlab.com/utopia-project/utopia>`_
(a modelling framework for complex and adaptive systems), but is an
independent package.
