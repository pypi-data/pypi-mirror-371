This is a [type stub package](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/external_libraries.html)
for the [`auth0-python`](https://github.com/auth0/auth0-python) package. It can be used by type checkers

All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/auth0-python`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/auth0-python)
