## UrbanMapper, In a Nutshell

`UrbanMapper` lets you link your data to spatial features—matching, for example, traffic events to streets—to enrich
each location with meaningful, location-based information. Formally, it defines a spatial enrichment
function $f(X, Y) = X \bowtie Y$, where $X$ represents urban layers (e.g., `Streets`, `Sidewalks`, `Intersections` and
more)
and $Y$ is a user-provided dataset (e.g., `traffic events`, `sensor data`). The operator $\bowtie$ performs a spatial
join, enriching each feature in $X$ with relevant attributes from $Y$.

In short, `UrbanMapper` is a Python toolkit that enriches typically plain urban layers with datasets in a reproducible,
shareable, and easily updatable way using minimal code. For example, given `traffic accident` data and a `streets` layer
from [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), you can compute accidents per street with
a [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)–style pipeline called the `Urban Pipeline`—in under 15 lines of code.
As your data evolves or team members want new analyses, you can share and update the `Urban Pipeline` like a trained
model, enabling others to run or extend the same workflow without rewriting code.

## Installation

Install `UrbanMapper` via ``pip`` (works in any environment):

 ```bash
 pip install urban-mapper
 ```

Then launch Jupyter Lab to explore `UrbanMapper`:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

> [!TIP]
> We recommend installing `UrbanMapper` in a virtual environment to keep things tidy and avoid dependency conflicts. You
> can find detailed instructions—including how to install within a virtual environment
> using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
> or from source in the [UrbanMapper Installation Guide](https://urbanmapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting-started/installation/).

# Urban Layers Currently Supported

`UrbanMapper` currently supports loading the following urban layers:

- **Street networks** (`roads` and `intersections`) from `OpenStreetMap`
  via [OSMNx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- **Pedestrian infrastructure** (`sidewalks` and `crosswalks`) via [`Tile2Net`](https://github.com/VIDA-NYU/tile2net) (
  automated mapping from aerial imagery)
- **City features** (`buildings`, `parks`, `bike lanes`, etc.) from `OpenStreetMap`
  via [OSMNx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
- **Administrative boundaries** (`neighborhoods`, `cities`, `states`, `countries`) from `OpenStreetMap`
  via [OSMNx](https://osmnx.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)

More layers, like `subway`/`tube` networks, will be added in the future. If you have any suggestions, please feel free
to
open an issue or a pull request!

# 🚀 Getting Started with UrbanMapper

Are you ready to dive into urban data analysis in a couple of lines of code? The simplest approach to get started with
`UrbanMapper` is to look
through the two getting-started examples available in the documentation then walk through the hands-on examples in the
`examples/` directory. Documentation is available
at [UrbanMapper Documentation](https://urbanmapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
