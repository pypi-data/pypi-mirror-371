"""C2PA bridge helpers (optional dependency).

Purpose: Embed a provenance bundle CID into a C2PA assertion for generated images so
verifiers can correlate media with its provenance passport / bundle.

We intentionally avoid adding heavy dependencies to the base install. To enable
C2PA embedding, install optional packages:

    pip install c2pa Pillow

Functions:
    embed_bundle_cid(image_path, bundle_cid, out_path=None) -> str
        Embeds the bundle CID as a simple custom assertion (or ingredient) and
        writes a new image with updated C2PA manifest. Returns output path.

If the 'c2pa' library is unavailable, a RuntimeError is raised with guidance.

NOTE: This is a minimal helper and does not sign with a production key. For a
real deployment, integrate a proper signing key and manifest store.
