    - *exclude* - draw the subset of the mark’s data *not* in the current facet
    - *super* - draw this mark in a single frame that covers all facets
    - null (or `False`) - repeat this mark’s data across all facets (*i.e.*, no faceting)

    When a mark uses *super* faceting, it is not allowed to use position scales
    (*x*, *y*, *fx*, or *fy*); *super* faceting is intended for decorations,
    such as labels and legends.

    When top-level faceting is used, the default *auto* setting is equivalent
    to *include* when the mark data is strictly equal to the top-level facet
    data; otherwise it is equivalent to null. When the *include* or *exclude*
    facet mode is chosen, the mark data must be parallel to the top-level facet
    data: the data must have the same length and order. If the data are not
    parallel, then the wrong data may be shown in each facet. The default
    *auto* therefore requires strict equality for safety, and using the
    facet data as mark data is recommended when using the *exclude* facet mode.

    When mark-level faceting is used, the default *auto* setting is equivalent
    to *include*: the mark will be faceted if either the **fx** or **fy**
    channel option (or both) is specified. The null or false option will
    disable faceting, while *exclude* draws the subset of the mark’s data *not*
