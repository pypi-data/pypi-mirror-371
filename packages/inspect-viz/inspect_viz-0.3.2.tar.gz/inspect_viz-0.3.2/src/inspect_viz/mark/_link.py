    """Create a link mark that draws line segments between pairs of points.

    The link mark connects pairs of points with line segments. It supports both
    simple positioning using x and y (which serve as shorthand for x1/x2 and y1/y2),
    and explicit positioning using x1/y1 and x2/y2 coordinates for full control
    over link endpoints.

    For vertical links, specify **x** (or **x1** and **x2**) for the horizontal
    position and **y1** and **y2** for the vertical endpoints. For horizontal links,
    specify **y** (or **y1** and **y2**) for the vertical position and **x1** and
    **x2** for the horizontal endpoints.

    Args:
        data: The data source for the mark.
        x: The horizontal position for vertical links; shorthand for x1 and x2.
        y: The vertical position for horizontal links; shorthand for y1 and y2.
        x1: The starting horizontal position; also sets default for x2.
        y1: The starting vertical position; also sets default for y2.
        x2: The ending horizontal position; also sets default for x1.
        y2: The ending vertical position; also sets default for y1.
        filter_by: Selection to filter by (defaults to data source selection).
        marker: Shorthand to set the same default for marker_start, marker_mid, and marker_end.
        marker_start: The marker for the starting point of a line segment.
        marker_mid: The marker for any middle (interior) points of a line segment.
        marker_end: The marker for the ending point of a line segment.
        curve: The curve interpolation method for connecting adjacent points.
            Recommended for links: *linear*, *step*, *step-after*, *step-before*,
            *bump-x*, *bump-y*.
        tension: The tension option only has an effect on bundle, cardinal and Catmullâ€“Rom splines.
        **options: Additional mark options from MarkOptions.

    Returns:
        A link mark.
