    The geo mark renders geographic data, typically GeoJSON objects, with support

    Args:
        data: The data source for the mark.
        geometry: A channel for the geometry to render; defaults to identity,
            assuming data is a GeoJSON object or iterable of GeoJSON objects.
            Supports various geographic data types and transformations.
        r: The radius channel for point geometries, typically bound to the
            *radius* scale.
        filter_by: Selection to filter by (defaults to data source selection).
        **options: Additional mark options from MarkOptions. Note that clip
