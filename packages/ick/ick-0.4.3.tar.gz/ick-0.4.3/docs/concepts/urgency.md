# Urgency

We break with convention of most tools that have a clearly-defined concept of
"error" vs "warning" or other levels, in favor of the more human-focused,
actionable "urgency."

While people can choose to run hooks in any order, this allows grouping and
inferences of their priorities.

For example, a pending deprecation in 3 months might be `"now"` and once it's
actually deprecated might be `"urgent"`.
