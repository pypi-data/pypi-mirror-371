# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [2.7.2]- 2025-08-20
- **Improved Dashboard Launch**: Passing Solver to env and launching dashboard
## [2.7.0]- 2025-08-20
- **New Map**: Larger nodes and edges 
- **Improved Dashboard Launch**: Cleaned Streamlit metrics

## [2.6.0] - 2025-08-17

### Added
- **New Environment Architecture**: `set_solver()`, `launch_dashboard()`, `run_headless()` methods
- **Simplified Main.py**: Super simple orchestrator that imports env and solver, passes solver to env
- **Enhanced Solver Integration**: Environment now handles solver execution and mode selection
- **Improved Dashboard Launch**: Proper Streamlit subprocess launching with error handling

### Changed
- **Main.py Refactored**: Now imports environment and solver, passes solver to environment
- **Environment Orchestration**: Environment handles launching dashboard or running headless
- **Architecture Flow**: Main.py → Environment → Solver → Dashboard/Headless execution
- **Usage Patterns**: Cleaner API for developers and contestants

### Fixed
- **Dashboard Launch**: Fixed Streamlit launching issues with proper subprocess handling
- **Environment Methods**: All new methods properly integrated and tested
- **Documentation**: Updated all docs to reflect new architecture
