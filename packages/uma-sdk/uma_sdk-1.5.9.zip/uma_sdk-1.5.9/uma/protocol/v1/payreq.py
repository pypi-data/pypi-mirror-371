class PayRequest(JSONable):
    sending_amount_currency_code: Optional[str]
    """
    The currency code of the `amount` field. `None` indicates that `amount` is in millisatoshis
    as in LNURL without LUD-21. If this is not `None`, then `amount` is in the smallest unit of
    the specified currency (e.g. cents for USD). This currency code can be any currency which
    the receiver can quote. However, there are two most common scenarios for UMA:

    1. If the sender wants the receiver wants to receive a specific amount in their receiving
    currency, then this field should be the same as `receiving_currency_code`. This is useful
    for cases where the sender wants to ensure that the receiver receives a specific amount
    in that destination currency, regardless of the exchange rate, for example, when paying
    for some goods or services in a foreign currency.

    2. If the sender has a specific amount in their own currency that they would like to send,
    then this field should be left as `None` to indicate that the amount is in millisatoshis.
    This will lock the sent amount on the sender side, and the receiver will receive the
    equivalent amount in their receiving currency. NOTE: In this scenario, the sending VASP
    *should not* pass the sending currency code here, as it is not relevant to the receiver.
    Rather, by specifying an invoice amount in msats, the sending VASP can ensure that their
    user will be sending a fixed amount, regardless of the exchange rate on the receiving side.
