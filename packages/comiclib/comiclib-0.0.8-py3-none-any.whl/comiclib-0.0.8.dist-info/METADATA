# 🚀 Installation
Make sure you have 🐍 Python ⩾ 3.9 installed, and install 📚 ComicLib with the following command
```
pip install -U "comiclib[full]"
```
Then run the following command in the location of your comic library to start
```
comiclib
```
It will automatically scan the comics in the current working directory.

Now you can open http://127.0.0.1:8000 and start reading.

# 🍰 One more step

## Specify the location for scanning comics
The default scan location is the current working directory, which can be specified via the environment variable `CONTENT`.
For example, you can add it before the command
```
CONTENT=/home/user/mycomics comiclib
```

## Modify the bound port or IP address
Instead of run `comiclib` directly, run with the following command
```
uvicorn comiclib.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80
```
where `--host 0.0.0.0` specifies the bound IP (`0.0.0.0` enables LAN access), and `--port 80` specifies the bound port.

📄 Please see the [documentation](https://ComicLib.github.io/comiclib/en/) for more settings.
