# shakemap-modules

## Introduction

This repository holds the core modules of the ShakeMap processing software. The modules may be used either as
a library of classes that can be included in other programs (as they are with ShakeMap), or as standalone 
programs. See the [ShakeMap Documentation](https://ghsc.code-pages.usgs.gov/esi/shakemap/) for more on ShakeMap
and its software architecture.

## Installation

To install the library modules, use pip:

    pip install shakemap-modules

To install as standalone modules, clone the repository, and execute:

    bash install.sh

which will create a conda environment with the various dependencies.
