# gmpe_sets: Specify the GMPE sets available to ShakeMap's model module.
# Each sub-section below allows the specification of a set of one or more
# GMPEs to combine together to be treated as a single GMPE by the model
# module. The output of the combined module will be the weighted average 
# combination of the outputs of the individual modules. The parameters
# for each GMPE set are:
#
# - gmpes: A list of one or more GMPE modules. The modules must be the
#          GMPE's short name as defined in modules.conf. If a specified
#          GMPE does not produce the required IMT, then that GMPE is
#          dropped and the weights (see below) of the remaining GMPEs
#          is rebalanced.
# - weights: A list of weights to apply to each of the 'gmpes' specified
#          (in the same order they are specified in the 'gmpes' list).
#          The weights must sum to 1.0.
#
# NOTE:
#     - To use a single GMPE, it needs to be defined as a gmpe_set.
#     - Some of the gmpe_sets below for single events were included
#       for migration purposes and have not been tested.
