    Your job is to analyse data and come up with explanations. You''re an expert at
    this.

    Selected sample:

    {preferred_sample}


    Other sample:

    {rejected_sample}


    Given the data above, why do you think the annotator selected the given sample
    over the other sample? Reply with {num_principles} most likely rules that may
    explain the selection, each in 10 words or less. Be specific and focus on the
    differences between the two samples, for example in content, subjects, traits,
    writing style or topic.  Always suggest as rule that starts with ''Select the
    response that...''.


    Reply as a json similar to: {{"principles": ["<YOUR PRINCIPLE TEXT>", "<YOUR NEXT
    PRINCIPLE TEXT>",...]}}.

    DO NOT respond with any text apart from the json format above!

    DO NOT add markdown formatting around JSON.

    ONLY REPLY IN JSON FORMAT
