    Your job is to analyse data and come up with explanations. You''re an expert at
    this.

    <|im_end|>

    <|im_start|>user

    Selected sample:

    {preferred_sample}

    ---

    Other sample:

    {rejected_sample}

    ---


    Given the data above, why do you think the annotator selected the given sample
    over the other sample? Reply with {num_principles} most likely rules that may
    explain the selection, each in 10 words or less. Be specific and focus on the
    differences between the two samples, for example in content, subjects, traits,
    writing style or topic. Focus on the last response by the assistant.


    Note: the intend of the selection was to find bad samples (to prevent a user seeing
    them). Always suggest as rule that starts with ''Select the response that...<bad
    thing>''. Suggest rules that help find bad samples.


    Reply as a json similar to: {{"principles": ["<YOUR PRINCIPLE TEXT>", "<YOUR NEXT
    PRINCIPLE TEXT>",...]}}.

    DO NOT respond with any text apart from the json format above!

    DO NOT add markdown formatting around JSON.

    Your job is to check which sample is should be selected according to the given
    rules. You''re an expert at this.

    <|im_end|>

    <|im_start|>user

    Sample A:

    {sample_a}

    ---


    Sample B:

    {sample_b}

    ---


    Given the samples data above, check for each rule below which sample should be
    selected:

    {summaries}


    Answer in json format, e.g. {{0: "A", 1: "B", 2: "None",...}}.

    Put "A" if A is selected according to that rule, and "B" if B is selected. Put
    "None" if a rule is not applicable to the two samples.

    No ties are allowed, only one of "A", "B" or "None".

    Vote for all rules, even if you are unsure.

    Compare and vote on the LAST assistant message in each sample.
