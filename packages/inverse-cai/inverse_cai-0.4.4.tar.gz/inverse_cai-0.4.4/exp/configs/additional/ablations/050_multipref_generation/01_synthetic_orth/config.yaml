    Given the data above, why do you think the annotator selected the given samples
    over the other samples? Reply with {num_principles} most likely rules that may
    explain the selections, each in 10 words or less. Be specific and focus on the
    differences between the pairs, for example in content, subjects, traits, writing
    style or topic.

    Note: the intend of the selection was to find bad samples (to prevent a user seeing
    them). Always suggest as rule that starts with ''Select the response that...<bad
    thing>''. Suggest rules that help find bad samples.
