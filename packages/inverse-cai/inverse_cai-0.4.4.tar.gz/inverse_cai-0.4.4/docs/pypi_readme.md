This package contains the official implementation of the *Inverse Constitutional AI* (ICAI) algorithm [[paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06560). ICAI compresses pairwise preference datasets into a readable list of principles (constitution) that the annotations appear to follow (e.g. "select the friendlier response"). ICAI principles provide an interpretable overview of a feedback dataset.
