"""Memory testing script for ai-ffmpeg-cli.

This module provides comprehensive memory leak detection for the ai-ffmpeg-cli package.
It tests various scenarios including basic operations, large file lists, concurrent
operations, long-running processes, and error conditions.

Key assumptions:
- Memory increases >5MB indicate potential leaks (basic/concurrent/error tests)
- Memory increases >10MB indicate potential leaks (large file lists)
- psutil is available for memory monitoring
- Garbage collection is forced periodically to isolate memory issues
