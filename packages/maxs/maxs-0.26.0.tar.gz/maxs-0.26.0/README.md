## smart features

## smart features

### üß† **advanced memory systems**
maxs has sophisticated context awareness:
```bash
# triple memory architecture
maxs "remember: we're using react for the frontend"  # stored in sqlite + bedrock
maxs "what frontend tech are we using?"              # recalls from memory
# searches across: sqlite full-text + aws bedrock + conversation history
```

memory features:
- **sqlite memory** - full-text search, sql queries, rich metadata
- **knowledge base** - aws bedrock semantic search and storage  
- **conversation context** - remembers 200+ recent messages
- **distributed memory** - shares context with team members

### üéôÔ∏è **voice interaction**
hands-free operation with natural conversation:
```bash
# start voice mode
maxs
> listen(action="start", trigger_keyword="max")

# then just speak naturally
"max, analyze the database performance"     # creates reports
"max, deploy to staging"                    # runs deployment scripts
"max, create a monitoring dashboard"        # builds visualization tools
```

### üî• **hot reload development**
extend capabilities instantly without restart:
```bash
# session 1: create tool
maxs "create a weather tool for openweathermap"
# saves to ./tools/weather.py

# session 2: tool ready immediately  
maxs "get weather for tokyo"
# uses the newly created weather tool
```

### ü§ù **context-aware automation**
maxs understands your workflow and environment:
```bash
# maxs sees your recent git commands
$ git clone https://github.com/user/repo
$ cd repo
$ maxs "analyze this codebase and suggest improvements"
# automatically knows you're working with a fresh repo

# maxs remembers project context
maxs "we're using postgresql"           # stores in memory
# later...
maxs "create database migration script" # remembers postgresql context
```

## team collaboration (advanced)

**first, enable team features:**
```bash
# enable event_bridge tool
export STRANDS_TOOLS="bash,environment,tcp,scraper,use_agent,tasks,event_bridge"
maxs
```

when multiple people use maxs with shared aws setup:

```bash
# developer 1 (local)
maxs "implementing payment processing"

# developer 2 (sees context from dev 1)  
maxs "i see you're working on payments, let me test the api"

# ci/cd pipeline (sees both contexts)
maxs "payment feature tested successfully, deploying to staging"
```

**how to enable team mode:**
1. enable event_bridge tool (see above)
2. set up aws credentials (`aws configure`)
3. one person runs: `maxs "setup event bridge for team collaboration"`
4. team members use same aws account
5. everyone's maxs instances share context automatically
