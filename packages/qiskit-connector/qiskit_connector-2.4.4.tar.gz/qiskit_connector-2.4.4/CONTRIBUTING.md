## How to Contribute

### 1. Open an Issue

If you find a bug, have a question, or wish to propose an enhancement, please [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/QComputingSoftware/pypi-qiskit-connector/issues).  
Be sure to include as much context as possible (steps to reproduce, error messages, environment, etc.).

### 2. Fork and Clone

- Fork the [main repository](https://github.com/QComputingSoftware/pypi-qiskit-connector)
- Clone your fork:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/your-username/pypi-qiskit-connector.git
  cd pypi-qiskit-connector
  ```

- Set up the upstream remote:

  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/QComputingSoftware/pypi-qiskit-connector.git
  ```

### 3. Set Up Your Development Environment

- Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed.
- (Recommended) Use a virtual environment:

[Use Qiskit Tool Setup Wizard ](https://github.com/schijioke-uche/quantum-computing-qiskit-tool-wizard)
Takes 5mins

- For contributors working on core quantum features, ensure Qiskit and required quantum SDKs are up to date.

### 4. Making a Pull Request

- Create a new branch for your fix or feature:
  ```bash
  git checkout -b my-feature-branch
  ```
- Make your changes.  
- Include clear commit messages.
- Add or update tests as needed (`tests/` folder).
- Ensure all tests pass:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- Commit and push to your fork:
  ```bash
