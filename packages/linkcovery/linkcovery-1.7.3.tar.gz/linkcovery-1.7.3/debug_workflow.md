# Workflow Debug Info

## Expected Behavior
When a `fix:` commit is pushed, the workflow should:

1. **Release Job**: 
   - Run semantic-release
   - Create new version (v1.7.3)
   - Set `new_release_published` to `'true'`
   - Set `new_release_version` to `'1.7.3'`

2. **Build-Binaries Job**:
   - Check condition: `needs.release.outputs.new_release_published == 'true'`
   - If true, run the job
   - Build binaries for Linux and macOS
   - Upload to the GitHub release

## Current Status
- ✅ v1.7.2 was created successfully
- ❓ Build job status unclear

## Possible Issues
1. Timing - build job might still be running
2. Condition evaluation - might need to check exact string comparison
3. Workflow permissions - might need additional permissions

## Next Steps
1. Check GitHub Actions page for real-time status
2. If still failing, add more debug output
3. Consider manual workflow trigger
