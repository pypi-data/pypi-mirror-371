## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and Clone
1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/xsoar-cli.git
   cd xsoar-cli
   ```

### 2. Set Up Development Environment
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt

# Install the package in development mode
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Verify Setup
```bash
# Run tests to ensure everything works
pytest

# Check code style
black --check src/ tests/

# Run the CLI to verify installation
xsoar-cli --help
```

## Development Workflow

### Making Changes
1. **Create a feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** (code, docs, tests)

3. **Run quality checks**:
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   pytest
   
   # Format code
   black src/ tests/
   
   # Check for any issues
   python -m pytest --cov=src/xsoar_cli
   ```

4. **Commit with clear messages**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add feature: brief description of what you added"
   ```

5. **Push and create Pull Request**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

### Code Style
- We use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting
- Run `black src/ tests/` before committing
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Add type hints where appropriate
- Write docstrings for new functions and classes

### Testing
- Add tests for new features
- Ensure existing tests still pass
- Aim for good test coverage
- Test commands work with both XSOAR v6 and v8 when applicable
