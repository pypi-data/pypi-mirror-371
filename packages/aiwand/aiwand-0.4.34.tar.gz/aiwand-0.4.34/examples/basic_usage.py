    Machine learning is a method of data analysis that automates analytical 
    model building. It is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) based on 
    the idea that systems can learn from data, identify patterns and make 
    decisions with minimal human intervention. Machine learning algorithms 
    build a mathematical model based on training data, in order to make 
    predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so.
    The process of machine learning involves training algorithms on large 
    datasets to recognize patterns and relationships. These algorithms can 
    then be applied to new data to make predictions or classifications. 
    Common applications include image recognition, natural language processing, 
    recommendation systems, and autonomous vehicles.
