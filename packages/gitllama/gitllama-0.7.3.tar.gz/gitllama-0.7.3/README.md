# GitLlama ü¶ô

A git automation tool that uses AI to analyze repositories and make code changes. GitLlama clones a repository, analyzes the codebase, selects an appropriate branch, and makes iterative improvements.

## Core Design: 4 Query Types with Templates

GitLlama's AI decision-making is built on a comprehensive 4-query system with structured templates:

- **üî§ Multiple Choice**: Lettered answers (A, B, C, etc.) for deterministic decisions
- **üìù Single Word**: Single word responses perfect for variable storage and simple classifications
- **üì∞ Open Response**: Essay-style detailed responses for complex analysis and explanations  
- **üìÑ File Write**: Complete file content generation with automatic formatting cleanup

Each query type uses carefully crafted templates with variable substitution, ensuring consistent, high-quality AI interactions while maintaining full Congressional oversight.

## Installation

```bash
pip install gitllama
```

## Prerequisites

GitLlama requires Ollama for AI features:

```bash
# Install Ollama
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh

# Start Ollama server
ollama serve

# Pull a model
ollama pull gemma3:4b
```

## Usage

### Basic usage:

```bash
gitllama https://github.com/user/repo.git
```

### With custom model:

```bash
gitllama https://github.com/user/repo.git --model llama3:8b
```

### With specific branch:

```bash
gitllama https://github.com/user/repo.git --branch feature/my-improvement
```

### Verbose mode:

```bash
gitllama https://github.com/user/repo.git --verbose
```

## How It Works

### 1. Repository Analysis
GitLlama analyzes the repository using hierarchical summarization:
- Scans all text files and documentation
- Groups files into chunks that fit the AI's context window
- Analyzes each chunk independently
- Merges summaries hierarchically
- Produces structured insights about the project

### 2. Branch Selection
The AI makes branch decisions using multiple choice queries:
- Analyzes existing branches
- Scores reuse potential
- Decides: REUSE or CREATE
- Selects branch type: feature, fix, docs, or chore

### 3. File Modification
Iterative development with validation:
- AI selects files to modify (multiple choice)
- Generates content (open response)
- Validates changes (multiple choice)
- Continues until satisfied

### 4. Commit and Push
- Generates commit message (open response)
- Commits changes
- Pushes to remote repository

## AI Query Interface

The 4-query system provides the right tool for every task:

```python
# Multiple choice for deterministic decisions with lettered answers
result = ai.multiple_choice(
    question="Should we reuse an existing branch?",
    options=["REUSE", "CREATE"],
    context="Current branch: main"
)
# Returns: letter='A', index=0, value='REUSE'

# Single word for variable storage and classifications
result = ai.single_word(
    question="What programming language is this?",
    context="Repository analysis shows..."
)
# Returns: word='Python'

# Open response for detailed analysis and explanations
result = ai.open(
    prompt="Explain the architecture benefits",
    context="Codebase structure and requirements..."
)
# Returns: content='Detailed essay-style response...'

# File write for generating complete file content
result = ai.file_write(
    requirements="Create a Python configuration file with database settings",
    context="Application uses PostgreSQL and Redis..."
)
# Returns: content='# config.py\nDATABASE_URL = "postgres://..."'
```

## Automatic Context Compression

GitLlama now includes intelligent context compression to handle large codebases that exceed model context limits:

### How It Works

When the AI context window is too large, GitLlama automatically:
1. Detects when context exceeds 70% of model capacity (reserves 30% for prompt/response)
2. Splits context into chunks and compresses each using AI summarization
3. Extracts only information relevant to the current query
4. Performs multiple compression rounds if needed (up to 3 rounds)
5. Tracks compression metrics for performance monitoring

### Features

- **Automatic Detection**: No configuration needed - compression triggers automatically
- **Query-Focused**: Compression preserves information relevant to the specific question
- **Multi-Round Compression**: Can perform up to 3 compression rounds for very large contexts
- **Metrics Tracking**: Records compression events, ratios, and success rates
- **Fallback Handling**: Gracefully degrades to truncation if compression fails

### Performance

- Typical compression ratios: 40-60% size reduction
- Minimal impact on response quality for focused queries
- Compression time: 2-5 seconds per round depending on context size

This feature ensures GitLlama can work with repositories of any size without manual context management.

## Congressional Oversight System üèõÔ∏è

GitLlama includes a novel Congressional voting system that provides governance and validation of AI decisions:

### How It Works

Every AI response is evaluated by three virtual Representatives with distinct personalities:

- **Senator Prudence (Conservative)**: Risk-averse, prioritizes accuracy and safety
- **Representative Innovation (Progressive)**: Forward-thinking, values practical solutions
- **Justice Balance (Neutral)**: Analytical, weighs pros and cons objectively

### Features

- **Automatic Evaluation**: All AI responses get Congressional review
- **Majority Voting**: Decisions require majority approval (2 out of 3 votes)
- **Detailed Reasoning**: Each Representative provides confidence scores and reasoning
- **Full Transparency**: All votes and reasoning included in HTML reports
- **Interactive Reports**: Hover over vote symbols to see detailed Representative feedback

### In Reports

Congressional votes appear inline with AI exchanges:
- üèõÔ∏è Congressional icon shows voting occurred
- ‚úì/‚úó symbols show individual Representative votes
- Hover tooltips reveal detailed reasoning and confidence scores
- Summary section shows overall voting patterns by Representative

This system ensures AI decisions undergo democratic review, adding a layer of validation and transparency to the automation process.

## Query Type System üéØ

GitLlama's enhanced 4-query system provides specialized tools for every AI interaction need:

### üî§ Multiple Choice Query
- **Purpose**: Deterministic decisions requiring selection from predefined options
- **Returns**: Letter (A, B, C, etc.), index, and option value
- **Template**: Structured prompt with lettered options and clear instructions
- **Best for**: Branch decisions, operation types, validation checks
- **Example**: Choose deployment strategy, select file operation, pick testing approach

### üìù Single Word Query  
- **Purpose**: Variable storage and simple classifications requiring one-word answers
- **Returns**: Single cleaned word with confidence score
- **Template**: Focused prompt emphasizing single-word response requirement
- **Best for**: Language detection, status indicators, simple categorization
- **Example**: Programming language, file type, priority level

### üì∞ Open Response Query
- **Purpose**: Detailed analysis, explanations, and complex reasoning tasks
- **Returns**: Comprehensive text content with proper formatting
- **Template**: Essay-style prompt encouraging detailed, structured responses  
- **Best for**: Architecture explanations, code analysis, documentation generation
- **Example**: Explain design patterns, analyze code complexity, describe system benefits

### üìÑ File Write Query

- **Returns**: Clean file content with automatic formatting and code block removal
- **Template**: File-focused prompt with clear content requirements
- **Best for**: Configuration files, code generation, documentation creation
