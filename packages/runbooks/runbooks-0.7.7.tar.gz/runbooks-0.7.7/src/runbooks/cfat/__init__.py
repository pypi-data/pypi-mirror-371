following Cloud Foundations best practices with enterprise-grade
features including:

- Multi-format reporting (HTML, CSV, JSON, Markdown)

    from runbooks.cfat import AssessmentRunner, Severity

    # Initialize and configure assessment
    runner = AssessmentRunner(profile="prod", region="us-east-1")
    runner.set_min_severity(Severity.WARNING)

    # Run assessment
    report = runner.run_assessment()

    # Export results
    report.to_html("assessment_report.html")
    report.to_json("findings.json")

    print(f"Compliance Score: {report.summary.compliance_score}/100")
    print(f"Critical Issues: {report.summary.critical_issues}")
    ```
