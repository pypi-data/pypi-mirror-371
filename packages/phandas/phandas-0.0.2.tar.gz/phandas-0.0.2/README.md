# Phandas

**Phandas** is a Python library for quantitative analysis and multi-factor strategy backtesting in cryptocurrency markets, developed by **Phantom Management**.

This project is currently in the planning and development phase. The name has been registered on PyPI to reserve it for future use.

## Vision

Our goal is to provide a powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source tool for crypto quants and researchers, inspired by the robustness of tools like `pandas` and `numpy`.

## Installation

Once the first version is released, you will be able to install it via pip:

```bash
pip install phandas
```

Stay tuned for future updates!
