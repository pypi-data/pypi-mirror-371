    This release adds a new config option require_secure to the spice
    configuration group. Defaulting to false to match the previous
    behavior, if set to true the SPICE consoles will require TLS
    protected connections. Unencrypted connections will be gracefully
    redirected to the TLS port via the SPICE protocol.
