           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# ai-coustics SDK for Python (`aic`)

[![Integration Tests](https://github.com/ai-coustics/aic-sdk-py/actions/workflows/post-publish-tests.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ai-coustics/aic-sdk-py/actions/workflows/post-publish-tests.yml)

[![Python 3.10+](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.10+-blue.svg)](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

This repository provides prebuilt Python wheels for the **ai-coustics real-time audio enhancement SDK**, compatible with a variety of platforms and Python versions. The SDK offers state-of-the-art neural network-based audio enhancement for speech processing applications.

## 🚀 Features

- **Real-time audio enhancement** using advanced neural networks
- **Multiple model variants**: QUAIL_L, QUAIL_S, QUAIL_XS for different performance/quality trade-offs
- **Low latency processing** optimized for streaming applications
- **Cross-platform support**: Linux, macOS, Windows
- **Context manager support** for automatic resource management

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- GLIBC >= 2.28 on Linux

### Install the SDK

```bash
pip install aic-sdk
```

### For Development/Examples

To run the examples, install additional dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r examples/requirements.txt
```

## 🔑 License Key Setup

The SDK requires a license key for full functionality.

1. **Get a license key** from [ai-coustics](https://ai-coustics.com)
2. **Set an environment variable** (or a `.env` file):
   ```bash
   export AICOUSTICS_API_KEY="your_license_key_here"
   ```
   Or in a `.env` file:
   ```
   AICOUSTICS_API_KEY=your_license_key_here
   ```
3. **Pass the key to the model** (the SDK does not read env vars automatically):
   ```python
   import os
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   from aic import Model, AICModelType

   load_dotenv()  # loads .env if present
   license_key = os.getenv("AICOUSTICS_API_KEY")

   with Model(AICModelType.QUAIL_L, license_key=license_key, sample_rate=48000, channels=1, frames=480) as model:
       # ...
   ```

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Basic Audio Enhancement

```python
import os
import numpy as np
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from aic import Model, AICModelType, AICParameter

load_dotenv()
license_key = os.getenv("AICOUSTICS_API_KEY")

# Create model instance
model = Model(
    model_type=AICModelType.QUAIL_L,
    license_key=license_key,   # pass the key from env (empty = trial)
    sample_rate=48000,
    channels=1,
    frames=480,
)

# Set enhancement strength (0.0 to 1.0)
model.set_parameter(AICParameter.ENHANCEMENT_LEVEL, 0.8)

# Process audio (planar format: [channels, frames])
audio_input = np.random.randn(1, 480).astype(np.float32)
enhanced_audio = model.process(audio_input)

# Clean up
model.close()
```

### Using Context Manager (Recommended)

```python
import os
import numpy as np
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from aic import Model, AICModelType

load_dotenv()
license_key = os.getenv("AICOUSTICS_API_KEY", "")

with Model(AICModelType.QUAIL_L, license_key=license_key, sample_rate=48000, channels=1, frames=480) as model:
    # Process audio in chunks
    audio_chunk = np.random.randn(1, 480).astype(np.float32)
    enhanced = model.process(audio_chunk)
    # Model automatically closed when exiting context
```

## 📁 Example: Enhance WAV File

The repository includes a complete example for processing WAV files:

```bash
python examples/enhance.py input.wav output.wav --strength 80
```

### Example Usage

```python
import librosa
import soundfile as sf
from aic import Model, AICModelType, AICParameter

def enhance_wav_file(input_path, output_path, strength=80):
    # Load audio
    audio, sample_rate = librosa.load(input_path, sr=48000, mono=True)
    audio = audio.reshape(1, -1)  # Convert to planar format
    
    # Create model
    from dotenv import load_dotenv
    import os

    load_dotenv()
    license_key = os.getenv("AICOUSTICS_API_KEY")

    with Model(AICModelType.QUAIL_L, license_key=license_key, sample_rate=48000, channels=1, frames=480) as model:
        model.set_parameter(AICParameter.ENHANCEMENT_LEVEL, strength / 100)
        
        # Process in chunks
        chunk_size = 480
        output = np.zeros_like(audio)
        
        for i in range(0, audio.shape[1], chunk_size):
            chunk = audio[:, i:i + chunk_size]
            # Pad last chunk if needed
            if chunk.shape[1] < chunk_size:
                padded = np.zeros((1, chunk_size), dtype=audio.dtype)
                padded[:, :chunk.shape[1]] = chunk
                chunk = padded
            
            enhanced_chunk = model.process(chunk)
            output[:, i:i + chunk_size] = enhanced_chunk[:, :chunk.shape[1]]
    
    # Save result
    sf.write(output_path, output.T, sample_rate)
```

## 🔧 API Reference

For the complete, up-to-date API documentation (including class/method docs and enums), see the published site:

- [ai-coustics SDK for Python – Documentation](https://ai-coustics.github.io/aic-sdk-py/)

## 🎵 Audio Format Requirements

- **Sample Rate**: 48kHz recommended (optimal for all models)
- **Format**: Float32 in linear -1.0 to +1.0 range
- **Layout**: 
  - Planar: `(channels, frames)` - use `process()`
  - Interleaved: `(frames,)` - use `process_interleaved()`
- **Channels**: Mono (1) or stereo (2) supported

## 🔄 Processing Patterns

### Real-time Streaming

```python
with Model(AICModelType.QUAIL_S, sample_rate=48000, channels=1, frames=480) as model:
    
    while audio_stream.has_data():
        chunk = audio_stream.get_chunk(480)  # Get 480 frames
        enhanced = model.process(chunk)
        audio_output.play(enhanced)
```

### Batch Processing

```python
with Model(AICModelType.QUAIL_L, sample_rate=48000, channels=1, frames=480) as model:
    
    for audio_file in audio_files:
        audio = load_audio(audio_file)
        enhanced = process_in_chunks(model, audio)
        save_audio(enhanced, f"enhanced_{audio_file}")
```

## 🧑‍💻 Development

### Setup

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # includes editable install (-e .)
```

### Pre-commit hooks (Ruff)

```bash
pre-commit install
pre-commit run --all-files
```

This runs Ruff linting and formatting on commit. You can also run Ruff manually:

```bash
ruff check . --fix
ruff format .
```

### Running tests

- Unit tests (no native SDK required):

```bash
pytest -q
```

- Integration tests (real SDK + license required):

```bash
export AICOUSTICS_API_KEY="your_key"  # or use a .env file
pytest -q integration_tests
```

Note: To run against the real native SDK locally, it is simplest to install the package non-editable so the platform binaries are bundled:

```bash
pip uninstall -y aic-sdk
pip install .
```

Editable installs (`-e .`) do not place native binaries into the source tree. The unit test suite does not need them; the integration suite does.

### Docs (MkDocs)

```bash
mkdocs serve   # live-reload docs at http://127.0.0.1:8000
# or
mkdocs build
```

### Versioning

- Python wrapper version: `pyproject.toml` → `[project].version`
- C SDK binary version: `pyproject.toml` → `[tool.aic-sdk].sdk-version`

The Python version and the underlying C SDK version are intentionally decoupled. The build step downloads platform binaries named from `sdk-version`.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"GLIBC"**: On Linux you need to have GLIBC >= 2.28
2. **"Array shape error"**: Ensure audio is in correct format (planar or interleaved)
3. **"Sample rate mismatch"**: Use 48kHz for optimal performance

### Performance Tips

- Use `QUAIL_XS` for applications that need lower latency
- Process in chunks of `optimal_num_frames()` size
- Use context manager for automatic cleanup
- Pre-allocate output arrays to avoid memory allocation
