# EJdate

EJdate is a Python library for working easily with both **Jalali (Shamsi)** and **Gregorian** dates.

> 🗓️ "Jalali" (also known as *Shamsi* in Persian) is the official solar calendar used in Iran.

- Combines Gregorian and Jalali in one class
- Smart date formatting in Persian and English
- Weekend detection (Friday)
- Day difference calculation
- Developer-friendly, clean and modular
- Localization support
