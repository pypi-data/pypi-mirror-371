# PyRend

**PyRend** is a Python library for rendering invisible overlays on top of the desktop. It allows you to draw shapes, images, video, and text over any running application, including windowed or borderless windowed games, without showing a visible window or stealing focus.

It also includes support for playing and recording audio, handling video playback, and capturing/controlling keyboard input. PyRend is designed for scenarios where you want full control over what is drawn on screen, without creating a traditional GUI application, plus many more features.

You can check out the PyRend documentation [here](https://pyrend.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
