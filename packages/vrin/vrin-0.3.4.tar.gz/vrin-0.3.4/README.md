## 📦 Installation

```bash
pip install vrin==0.3.3
```

## 🔧 Quick Start

```python
from vrin import VRINClient

# Initialize with your API key
client = VRINClient(api_key="your_vrin_api_key")

# STEP 1: Define your custom AI expert
result = client.specialize(
    custom_prompt="You are a senior M&A legal partner with 25+ years experience...",
    reasoning_focus=["cross_document_synthesis", "causal_chains"],
    analysis_depth="expert"
)

# STEP 2: Insert knowledge with automatic fact extraction
result = client.insert(
    content="Complex M&A legal document content...",
    title="Strategic M&A Assessment"
)
print(f"✅ Extracted {result['facts_count']} facts")
print(f"💾 Storage: {result['storage_details']}")

# STEP 3: Query with expert-level reasoning
response = client.query("What are the strategic litigation opportunities?")
print(f"📝 Expert Analysis: {response['summary']}")
print(f"🔗 Multi-hop Chains: {response['multi_hop_chains']}")
print(f"📊 Cross-doc Patterns: {response['cross_document_patterns']}")
print(f"⚡ Performance: {response['search_time']}")
```

## 📊 Performance (v0.3.3 Production)

- **Expert Queries**: < 20s for multi-hop analysis with reasoning chains
- **Graph Retrieval**: Now finding 36-50 facts (fixed from 0 facts)
- **Multi-hop Reasoning**: 1-10 reasoning chains per complex query
- **Cross-document Patterns**: 2+ patterns detected per expert analysis
- **Storage Efficiency**: 40-60% reduction through intelligent deduplication
- **Expert Validation**: 8.5/10 performance on professional M&A analysis
- **Infrastructure**: 11 Lambda functions, sub-second API response

## 🏗️ Architecture

VRIN uses enterprise-grade Hybrid RAG with user-defined specialization:

1. **User Specialization** - Custom AI experts defined by users
2. **Enhanced Fact Extraction** - Fixed Neptune storage with proper edge relationships
3. **Multi-hop Reasoning** - Cross-document synthesis with reasoning chains
4. **Hybrid Retrieval** - Graph traversal + vector similarity (36-50 facts)
5. **Expert Synthesis** - Domain-specific analysis using custom prompts
6. **Production Infrastructure** - 11 Lambda functions on AWS
7. **Enterprise Security** - Bearer token auth, user isolation, compliance

## 🔐 Authentication & Setup

1. Sign up at [VRIN Console](https://console.vrin.ai) (when available)
2. Get your API key from account dashboard
3. Use the API key to initialize your client
