General Information
-------------------

AUTO² or auto-AUTO is an [AUTO](https://github.com/auto-07p/auto-07p) automatic search algorithm codebase
to enhance the original AUTO-07p Python interface with a top layer which allows users to:

* automate the continuation of as many branches as possible, branching whenever possible to construct full
  bifurcation trees, and finishing computations based on a predefined logic
  (meeting other branches, looping branches, etc...)
* plot results with [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
* perform these computations in [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org) notebooks

About
-----

(c) 2025 Jonathan Demaeyer and Oísin Hamilton. 

See [LICENSE.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Climdyn/auto-AUTO/master/LICENSE.txt) for license information.

Please consult the auto-AUTO [code repository](http://www.github.com/Climdyn/auto-AUTO) for updates.

Installation
------------

#### Installing AUTO

> To use auto-AUTO, you need the [bleeding edge version of AUTO](https://github.com/auto-07p/auto-07p) available 
> on GitHub for this codebase to work properly !

Here how to install AUTO from GitHub:

First clone the AUTO repository somewhere:

    git clone https://github.com/auto-07p/auto-07p.git

Then in a terminal, in the created folder, run:

    ./configure
    make

Your AUTO installation should now be finished, but you still need to add the 
following line to your `.bashrc` file:

    source [path-to-auto-07p]/cmds/auto.env.sh

In addition, we recommend that you edit the file `auto.env.sh` so that the `AUTO_DIR` environment 
variable specified there points to the correct folder where you installed AUTO.

 > Be sure to have all the AUTO requirements pre-installed. See AUTO documentation for 
> more details. In case of issues, we recommend reading the documentation completely.

After that last step, you should be able to launch AUTO in command line by typing:

    auto

If it works, you will end up in the AUTO Python prompt.
It means you have AUTO properly configured and are ready to install auto-AUTO.

> If AUTO version is changing over time, you need to update the version from GitHub and do
> the installation again.

#### Installing auto-AUTO with pip

The easiest way to install and run qgs is to use [pip](https://pypi.org/).
Type in a terminal

    pip install auto-AUTO

and you are set!

#### Installing auto-AUTO with Anaconda

The second-easiest way to install and run qgs is to use an appropriate 
environment created through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).

First install Anaconda and clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/Climdyn/auto-AUTO.git

Then install and activate the Python3 Anaconda environment:

    conda env create -f environment.yml
    conda activate auto2

and the code is installed. 


#### Testing the installation

You can test the Jupyter notebooks present in the 
[notebooks folder](./notebooks).
For instance, running

    conda activate auto2
    cd notebooks
    jupyter-notebook

will lead you to your favorite browser where you can load and run the examples.

Documentation
-------------

To build the documentation, please run (with the conda environment activated):

    cd documentation
    make html

Once built, the documentation is available [here](./documentation/build/html/index.html).

The documentation is also available online at https://climdyn.github.io/auto-AUTO .
