title: Event Fundamentals
---

Memobase automatically tracks key events and memories from user interactions, creating a chronological record of their experiences.

```python
from memobase import MemoBaseClient, ChatBlob

# Initialize the client
client = MemoBaseClient(api_key="your_api_key")

# Create a user and insert a chat message
user = client.get_user(client.add_user())
user.insert(
    ChatBlob(
        messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "My name is Gus"}]
    )
)

# Retrieve the user's events
print(user.event())
```

## Event Structure

Each event object contains the following information:

-   **Event Summary** (Optional): A concise summary of the user's recent interaction. Learn more about [Event Summaries](/features/event/event_summary).
-   **Event Tags** (Optional): Semantic tags that categorize the event (e.g., `emotion::happy`, `goal::buy_a_house`). Learn how to [design custom tags](/features/event/event_tag).
-   **Profile Delta** (Required): The specific profile slots that were created or updated during this event.
-   **Created Time** (Required): The timestamp of when the event occurred.

A detailed description of the event format can be found in the [API Reference](/api-reference/events/get_events).
