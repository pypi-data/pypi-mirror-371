title: Using Event Tags
---

Event tags are a powerful feature for automatically categorizing user events with semantic attributes. You can use them to enrich event data and track user behavior over time across various dimensions, such as:

-   Emotion (`happy`, `frustrated`)
-   Life Goals (`buying_a_house`, `learning_a_skill`)
-   Relationships (`new_friend`, `family_mention`)

## Configuring Event Tags

By default, no event tags are recorded. You must define the tags you want to track in your `config.yaml` file:

```yaml config.yaml
event_tags:
  - name: "emotion"
    description: "Records the user's current emotional state."
  - name: "romance"
    description: "Tracks any mention of romantic relationships or feelings."
```

Once configured, Memobase will automatically analyze interactions and apply these tags to events when relevant. The `description` field is crucial for helping the AI accurately understand when to apply each tag.

## Retrieving Event Tags

Event tags are returned as part of the event object when you retrieve a user's event history.

```python
from memobase import MemoBaseClient

client = MemoBaseClient(project_url='YOUR_PROJECT_URL', api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')
user = client.get_user('some_user_id')

events = user.event()
for event in events:
    print(event.event_data.event_tags)
```

## Searching Events by Tag

You can also search for events that have specific tags applied.

```python
from memobase import MemoBaseClient

client = MemoBaseClient(project_url='YOUR_PROJECT_URL', api_key='YOUR_API_KEY')
user = client.get_user('some_user_id')

# Find all events tagged with 'emotion'
events = user.search_event(tags=["emotion"])
print(events)
```
