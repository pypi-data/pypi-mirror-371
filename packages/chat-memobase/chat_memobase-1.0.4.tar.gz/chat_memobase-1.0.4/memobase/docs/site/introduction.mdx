Struggling with short-term memory in your AI applications? Memobase is the solution.

It's a fast, scalable, long-term **user memory backend** for your AI, helping you build applications that remember and understand their users.

We currently support the following user memory types from chat interactions:
- [x] [Profile Memory](./features/profile/) - Understand who the user is.
- [x] [Event Memory](./features/event/) - Track what has happened in the user's life.
- [ ] Schedule Memory - Manage the user's calendar (Coming Soon).
- [ ] Social Memory - Map the user's relationships (Coming Soon).

Memobase is under active development, and we are looking for early adopters to become our design partners.
