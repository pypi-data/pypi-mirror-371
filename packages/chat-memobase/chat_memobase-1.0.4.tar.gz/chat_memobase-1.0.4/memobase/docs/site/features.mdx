## 🚀 What is Memobase?
- **AI-Powered Backend**: Memobase is a backend service designed to manage dynamic user profiles for your AI applications.
- **Automated Profile Building**: It analyzes user interactions to build rich, structured profiles, capturing everything from basic demographics to specific user preferences.
- **Personalized Experiences**: Leverage these detailed profiles to create highly personalized and engaging user experiences.
- **Scalable & Fast**: Built for performance, Memobase efficiently handles user data at any scale.

## 🖼️ User Profiles as Memory
- **Custom Memory Slots**: Define what your AI should remember. Whether it's a user's favorite color, their dog's name, or professional background, you can create custom fields for any data point.
- **Structured & Predictable**: User profiles are organized into a clear topic/subtopic structure (e.g., `interests/movies`), making them easy to parse and use in your AI logic.
- **Simple & Powerful**: This human-readable format is robust enough to store a lifetime of user memories.

## 👌 Core Use Cases
- **Long-Term Memory**: Give your AI the ability to remember past interactions and user details.
- **User Analysis**: Gain deep insights into user behavior and preferences to enhance your application.
- **Targeted Content**: Deliver personalized content, recommendations, and promotions that resonate with your users.

## 🤔 How It Works
- **Data Blobs**: Memobase stores user data in flexible "blobs." You can insert, retrieve, and delete these data chunks as needed.
- **Buffering System**: Recent data is held in a temporary buffer before being processed and integrated into the long-term user profile. This flush can be triggered automatically or manually.
- **Profile Evolution**: Over time, Memobase constructs comprehensive user profiles that enable your application to deliver truly personalized experiences.
