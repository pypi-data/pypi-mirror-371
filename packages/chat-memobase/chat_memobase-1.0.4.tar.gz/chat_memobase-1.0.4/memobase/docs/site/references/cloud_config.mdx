If you're using Memobase on cloud, you can refer to those sections to configure your memory backend:
- [User Profile](/features/profile)
- [User Event](/features/event)


In Memobase Cloud, we don't accept any LLM/Embedding model configuration for security reasons, all the LLM/Embedding costs are counted into [Memobase Tokens](https://www.memobase.io/pricing).
