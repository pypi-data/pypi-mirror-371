title: Async Python Client
---

Memobase also provides an async client in `python` SDK, it just the same as the sync client, but every method is async:
```python
from memobase import AsyncMemobaseClient

client = AsyncMemobaseClient(api_key="your_api_key")

async def main():
    assert await client.ping()
    #...
    
    # get user context
    u = await client.get_user(UID)
    print(await u.context())

    # get user profile
    print(await u.profile())

    # get user events
    print(await u.event(topk=10, max_token_size=1000))
```
