title: Performance and Cost
---

## Overview

Memobase is designed for high performance and cost-efficiency.

-   **Query Performance**: Queries are extremely fast because Memobase returns a pre-compiled user profile, eliminating the need for on-the-fly analysis.
-   **Controllable Costs**: You can manage costs by controlling the size of user profiles. This is done by configuring the number of profile slots and the maximum token size for each.
    -   Learn to design profile slots [here](/features/profile/profile_config).
    -   Learn to control token limits [here](/references/cloud_config).
-   **Insertion Efficiency**: New data is added to a buffer and processed in batches. This approach amortizes the cost of AI analysis, making insertions fast and inexpensive.
