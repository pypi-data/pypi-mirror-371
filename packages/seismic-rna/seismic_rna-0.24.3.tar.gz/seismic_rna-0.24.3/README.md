## About

SEISMIC-RNA analyzes data from RNA mutational profiling experiments,
such as [DMS-MaPseq](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.4057)
and [SHAPE-MaP](https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.3029).
This software introduces an optimized implementation of the algorithm
[DREEM](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2253-5) for detecting
and quantifying RNA structure ensembles.
