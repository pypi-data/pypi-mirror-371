List Formats
================================================================================

Using list files, one can list positions and reads that meet certain criteria,
as well as provide them to other commands.
All list files are in comma-separated values (CSV) format, which is advantageous
because it is both human-readable and widely supported by software including
Microsoft Excel and Python.
An example in CSV format is given for each type of list file.
