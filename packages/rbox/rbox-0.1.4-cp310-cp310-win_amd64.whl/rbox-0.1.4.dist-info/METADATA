**rbox** is a high-performance Rust library for seamlessly interacting with Pioneer DJ's Rekordbox software data.
It supports the following Rekordbox files:

- **Rekordbox database**: Query and update the Rekordbox v6/v7 master.db database through a type-safe ORM
- **XML database**: Read and write Rekordbox XML database files
- **Analysis Files**: Read and write ANLZ files containing waveforms, beat grids, hot cues and more
- **Settings Access**: Read and write My-Setting files


## 🔧 Installation

rbox is available on PyPI:
```bash
pip install rbox
```


## 🚀 Quick-Start

> **❗ Caution**:
> Please make sure to back up your Rekordbox collection before making changes to rekordbox data.
> The backup dialog can be found under "File" > "Library" > "Backup Library"

### Rekordbox 6/7 database

Rekordbox 6 and 7 use a SQLite database for storing the collection content.
Unfortunatly, the `master.db` SQLite database is encrypted using
[SQLCipher][sqlcipher], which means it can't be used without the encryption key.
However, since your data is stored and used locally, the key must be present on the
machine running Rekordbox.

rbox can unlock the new Rekordbox `master.db` SQLite database and provides
an easy interface for accessing and updating the data stored in it.

```python
from rbox import MasterDb

db = MasterDb()
contents = db.get_content()
for content in contents:
    print(content)
```


### Rekordbox XML

The Rekordbox XML database is used for importing (and exporting) Rekordbox collections
including track metadata and playlists. They can also be used to share playlists
between two databases.

rbox can read and write Rekordbox XML databases.

```python
from rbox import RekordboxXml

xml = RekordboxXml(path)
tracks = xml.get_tracks()
for track in tracks:
    print(track)
```


### Rekordbox ANLZ files

Rekordbox stores analysis information of the tracks in the collection in specific files,
which also get exported to decives used by Pioneer professional DJ equipment. The files
have names like `ANLZ0000` and come with the extensions `.DAT`, `.EXT` or `.2EX`.
They include waveforms, beat grids (information about the precise time at which
each beat occurs), time indices to allow efficient seeking to specific positions
inside variable bit-rate audio streams, and lists of memory cues and loop points.

rbox can parse and write all three analysis files.

```python
from rbox import Anlz

anlz = Anlz("ANLZ0000.DAT")
grid = anlz.get_beat_grid()
for beat in grid:
    print(f"Beat: {beat.beat_number} Tempo: {beat.tempo} Time: {beat.time}")
```


### Rekordbox My-Settings

Rekordbox stores the user settings in `*SETTING.DAT` files, which get exported to USB
devices. These files are either in the `PIONEER`directory of a USB drive
(device exports), but are also present for on local installations of Rekordbox 6.
The setting files store the settings found on the "DJ System" > "My Settings" page of
the Rekordbox preferences. These include language, LCD brightness, tempo fader range,
crossfader curve and other settings for Pioneer professional DJ equipment.

rbox supports both parsing and writing of My-Setting files.

```python
from rbox import Setting

sett = Setting(path)
print(f"Quantize: {sett.get_quantize()}")
sett.set_quantize("Off")
sett.dump()
```
