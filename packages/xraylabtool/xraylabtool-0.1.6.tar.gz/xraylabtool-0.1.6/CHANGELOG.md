## [0.1.5] - 2025-08-14

### Added
- New descriptive snake_case field names for XRayResult dataclass (e.g., `formula`, `molecular_weight_g_mol`, `critical_angle_degrees`)
- Comprehensive migration guide in README.md for transitioning from legacy field names
- Enhanced .gitignore to prevent system and build artifacts
- Backward compatibility via deprecated property aliases with deprecation warnings

### Changed
- **MAJOR**: XRayResult dataclass now uses descriptive snake_case field names instead of CamelCase
- Updated all documentation and examples to use new field names
- README.md examples now showcase both new (recommended) and legacy field usage
- Enhanced plotting examples with new field names

### Deprecated
- Legacy CamelCase field names (e.g., `Formula`, `MW`, `Critical_Angle`) - still functional but emit deprecation warnings
- Users should migrate to new snake_case field names for clearer, more maintainable code

### Removed
- System artifacts: .DS_Store files, __pycache__ directories, *.pyc files
- Build artifacts: docs/build directory

### Notes
- All numerical results and functionality remain identical - this is a non-breaking API enhancement
- Comprehensive test suite (145 tests) passes with new field names
- Legacy field names will be supported for several versions to ensure smooth migration

## [0.1.4] - 2025-01-14

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Renamed main functions for better readability and Python conventions:
  - `SubRefrac()` → `calculate_sub_refraction()`
  - `Refrac()` → `calculate_refraction()`
- Updated all documentation and examples to use new function names
- Updated test suite to use new function names (145 tests passing)
- Improved variable naming in internal functions for better code readability

### Fixed
- Updated installation test script to use new function names
- Updated Sphinx documentation configuration
- Maintained backward compatibility for XRayResult dataclass field names

### Documentation
- Updated README.md with all new function names
- Updated Sphinx documentation examples
- Updated test documentation
- All code examples now use descriptive function names

### Notes
- This is a **breaking change** for users calling `SubRefrac()` or `Refrac()` directly
- XRayResult dataclass fields remain unchanged (MW, f1, f2, etc.) for compatibility
- All numerical results and functionality remain identical
