class StochasticKriging(Kriging):
    r"""
    Class for the combined two-stage Kriging approach following [Morice_2021]_
    The first stage is to produce a gridded field from the observations using
    Ordinary Kriging. The second stage is to apply a perturbation.

    The perturbation is constructed by first generating a simulated state from
    the covariance matrix. A set of simulated observations is drawn from the
    error covariance matrix. A simulated gridded field is then computed using
    Simple Kriging with the simulated observations as input. Finally, the
    perturbation is then the difference between the simulated gridded field and
    the simulated state. This perturbation is added to the gridded field from
    the first stage.

    The equation for ordinary Kriging is:

    .. math::
        (C_{obs} + E)^{-1} \times C_{cross} \times y

    with a constant but unknown mean.

    In this case, the :math:`C_{obs}`, :math:`C_{cross}` and :math:`y` values
    are extended with a Lagrange multiplier term for the first stage, ensuring
    that the Kriging weights are constrained to sum to 1.

    Additionally, the matrix :math:`C_{obs}` is extended by one row and one
    column, each containing the value 1, except at the diagonal point, which is
    0 for the first Ordinary Kriging stage. The :math:`C_{cross}` matrix is
    extended by an extra row containing values of 1. Finally, the grid
    observations :math:`y` is extended by a single value of 0 at the end of the
    vector.

    Parameters
    ----------
    covariance : numpy.ndarray
        The spatial covariance matrix. This can be a pre-computed matrix loaded
        into the environment, or computed from a Variogram class or using
        Ellipse methods.
    idx : numpy.ndarray
        The 1d indices of observation grid points. These values should be
        between 0 and (N * M) - 1 where N, M are the number of longitudes
        and latitudes respectively. Note that these values should also be
        computed using "C" ordering in numpy reshaping. They can be
        computed from a grid using glomar_gridding.grid.map_to_grid. Each
        value should only appear once. Points that contain more than 1
        observation should be averaged. Used to compute the Kriging weights.
    obs : numpy.ndarray
        The observation values. If there are multiple observations in any
        grid box then these values need to be averaged into one value per
        grid box.
    error_cov : numpy.ndarray
        Error covariance values to the covariance between observation grid
        points.

        Solves the combined Stochastic Kriging problem. Computes the Kriging
        weights if the `kriging_weights` attribute is not already set.

        Stochastic Kriging is a combined Ordinary and Simple Kriging approach.
        First a gridded field is generated for the observations using Ordinary
        Kriging. Secondly, a simulated gridded field is generated using Simple
        Kriging from a simulated state and simulated observations. The simulated
        state can be pre-computed or computed by this method. The simulated
        observations are drawn from the error covariance and located at the
        simulated state. The difference between the simulated gridded field and
        the simulated state is added to the gridded field.

        The solution to Kriging is:

        .. math::
            (C_{obs} + E)^{-1} \times C_{cross} \times y

        Where :math:`C_{obs}` is the spatial covariance between grid-points
        with observations, :math:`E` is the error covariance between grid-points
        with observations, :math:`C_{cross}` is the covariance between
        grid-points with observations and all grid-points (including observation
        grid-points), and :math:`y` are the observation values.

        In this case, the :math:`C_{obs}`, :math:`C_{cross}` and are extended
        with a Lagrange multiplier term, ensuring that the Kriging weights are
        constrained to sum to 1. For the Ordinary Kriging component.

        The matrix :math:`C_{obs}` is extended by one row and one column, each
        containing the value 1, except at the diagonal point, which is 0. The
        :math:`C_{cross}` matrix is extended by an extra row containing values
        of 1. For the Ordinary Kriging component.

        This additionally sets the following attributes:

            - `gridded_field` - The unperturbed gridded field
            - `simulated_grid` - The simulated gridded field
            - `epsilon` - The perturbation

        Parameters
        ----------
        simulated_state : numpy.ndarray | None
            Flattened simulated state, used as the location basis for the
            simulated observation draw. If this is not provided it will be
            calculated. Often it is better to pre-compute a series of states in
            advance, since this can be a time consuming step (drawing a single
            state takes approximately the same time as drawing 200).

        Returns
        -------
        numpy.ndarray
            The solution to the stochastic Kriging problem (as a Vector, this
            may need to be re-shaped appropriately as a post-processing step).
