    covariance : numpy.ndarray
        The spatial covariance matrix. This can be a pre-computed matrix loaded

        Ellipse methods.
    idx : numpy.ndarray
        The 1d indices of observation grid points. These values should be
        between 0 and (N * M) - 1 where N, M are the number of longitudes

    obs : numpy.ndarray

class OrdinaryKriging(Kriging):

    Class for OrdinaryKriging.

    The equation for ordinary Kriging is:

    .. math::
        (C_{obs} + E)^{-1} \times C_{cross} \times y

    with a constant but unknown mean.

    In this case, the :math:`C_{obs}`, :math:`C_{cross}` and :math:`y` values
    are extended with a Lagrange multiplier term, ensuring that the Kriging
    weights are constrained to sum to 1.

    The matrix :math:`C_{obs}` is extended by one row and one column, each
    containing the value 1, except at the diagonal point, which is 0. The
    :math:`C_{cross}` matrix is extended by an extra row containing values of 1.
    Finally, the grid observations :math:`y` is extended by a single value of 0
    at the end of the vector.

        Compute the Kriging weights from the flattened grid indices where
        there is an observation, using a pre-computed inverse of the covariance
        between grid-points with observations.

        The Kriging weights are calculated as:

        .. math::
            (C_{obs} + E)^{-1} \times C_{cross}

        Where :math:`C_{obs}` is the spatial covariance between grid-points

        with observations, and :math:`C_{cross}` is the covariance between

        grid-points).

        In this case, the inverse matrix must be computed from the covariance

        This method is appropriate if one wants to compute the constraint mask
        which requires simple Kriging weights, which can be computed from the

        equation.

    Returns
    -------
    constraint_mask : numpy.ndarray
        Constraint mask values, the left-hand-side of equation A14 from Morice
        et al. (2021). This is a vector of length `k_obs.size[0]`.
