### OpenAI (Recommended for beginners)

2. **Set your API key** (choose one method):

   **Environment Variable (Recommended):**
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

   **In Python:**
   ```python
   import os
   os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key-here"
   ```

   **In a `.env` file:**
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

### Anthropic (Claude)

1. **Get an API key** from [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/)

   export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

### Google (Gemini)

# Check if Talk Box is working
bot = tb.ChatBot()
print("‚úÖ Talk Box installed successfully!")

# Check AI integration (requires API key)
try:
    response = bot.chat("Say hello!")
    print("‚úÖ AI integration working!")
    print(f"Response: {response.get_last_message().content}")
except Exception as e:
    print("‚ö†Ô∏è  AI integration needs setup:")
    print(f"   {e}")
    print("   See the AI Provider Setup section above")
```

## Installation Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'talk_box'"**

- Make sure you installed with the correct Python environment
- Try: `python -m pip install talk-box`

**"API key not found" errors**

- Verify your API key is set correctly
- Check the environment variable name matches your provider
- Restart your Python session after setting environment variables

**Permission errors on installation**

- Try: `pip install --user talk-box`
- Or use a virtual environment (recommended)

### Virtual Environment Setup (Recommended)

Using a virtual environment prevents package conflicts:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv talk-box-env

# Activate it
source talk-box-env/bin/activate  # On Windows: talk-box-env\Scripts\activate

# Install Talk Box
pip install talk-box

# Set your API keys
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
```
