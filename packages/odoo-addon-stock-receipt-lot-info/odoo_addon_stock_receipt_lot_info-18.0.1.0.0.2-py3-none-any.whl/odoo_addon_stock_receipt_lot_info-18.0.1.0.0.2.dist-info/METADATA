This module allows to encode more information to create lot/serial
numbers while processing an incoming shipment.

By default, you can only provide a lot/serial number name and its
expiration date when receiving products tracked by lot/serial numbers,
while the other dates listed below are automatically computed by Odoo.

- Lot/Serial Best before Date.
- Lot/Serial Removal Date.
- Lot/Serial Alert Date.

With this module you can also provide the information of those dates
manually overriding the automatic Odoo calculation.
