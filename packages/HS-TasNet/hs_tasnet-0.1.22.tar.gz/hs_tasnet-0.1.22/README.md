## HS-TasNet (wip)

Implementation of [HS-TasNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17701), "Real-time Low-latency Music Source Separation using Hybrid Spectrogram-TasNet", proposed by the research team at L-Acoustics

## Install

```bash
$ pip install HS-TasNet
```

## Usage

```python
# model

from hs_tasnet import HSTasNet

model = HSTasNet()

# the musdb dataset

import musdb
mus = musdb.DB(download = True)

# trainer

from hs_tasnet import Trainer

trainer = Trainer(
    model,
    dataset = mus,
    batch_size = 2,
    max_steps = 2,
    cpu = True,
)

trainer()

# after much training
# inferencing

model.sounddevice_stream(
    duration_seconds = 2,
    return_reduced_sources = [0, 2]
)

# or from the exponentially smoothed model (in the trainer)

trainer.ema_model.sounddevice_stream(...)

# or you can load from a specific checkpoint

model.load('./checkpoints/path.to.desired.ckpt.pt')
model.sounddevice_stream(...)

```
