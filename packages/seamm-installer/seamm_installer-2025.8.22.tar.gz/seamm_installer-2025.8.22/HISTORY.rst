History

2025.8.22: Bugfix: simplejson caused crash
    * If installed by one of the packages, simplejson caused the installer to crash
      because of an incompatibility between simplejson and the standard Python JSON
      package.
    * Improved feedback about progress when install and updating from the GUI.

2025.7.7: Bugfix: Ensure creation of ~/SEAMM directory

2025.6.21: Bugfix: error in path to Conda environments.
    * Fixed an error in the previous release that caused the code to get the incorrect
      path to the conda installation.
      
2025.6.6 -- Better handling of Conda paths
    * Some conda installations use paths rather than names. This may be common at
      computer centers with a central installation of the base environment and
      individual user installations of other environments. This version supports such
      installations.

2025.4.30 -- Bugfix: Issues in graphical install
    * Also added 'conda list --explicit' environment files for each environment.
      
2025.3.9 -- Significant update
    * Working with the new packing lists, generated by installing SEAMM now that we
      cannot programatically search PyPi.
    * Added support for dependencies with pinned versions, which is becoming increasingly
      necessary.
    * Use conda env update with custom environment file which include any pinning
      needed. This appears to avoid the problems with updating encountered with the last
      version.
      
2024.4.22 -- Moving user preferences to ~/.seamm.d
    * Moved seamm.ini from ~/SEAMM to ~/seamm.d since it only contains personal preferences.

2024.3.17 Enhancements
    * Install and update now use the latest version unless the package is pinned in the
      packing list.
    * Changes to support the plug-ion specific installs, which are now handling the
      specific <code>.ini files.
      
2024.3.11 Updating to work with new packing list.
    * Versions of packages are now stored as strings and compared using semver, since
      the older approach is being deprecated in Python.
