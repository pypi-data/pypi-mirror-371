# Configuration options for SEAMM.
#
# The options in this file override any defaults in SEAMM
# and its plug-ins; however, command-line arguments will
# in turn override the values here.
#
# The keys should have dashes '-' separating words. In either case,
# the command line options is '--<key with dashes>' and the variable
# name inside SEAMM is '<key with underscores>', e.g. 'log-level' in
# this file corresponds to the command line option '--log-level'
# and the variable in SEAMM 'log_level'.
#
# The file is broken into sections, with a name in square brackets,
# like [lammps-step]. Within each section there can be a series of
# option = value statements. '#' introduces comment lines. The
# section names and variables should be in lower case except for
# the [DEFAULT] and [SEAMM] sections which are special.
#
# [DEFAULT] provides default values for any other section. If an
# option is requested for a section, but does not exist in that
# section, the option is looked for in the [DEFAULT] section. If it
# exists there, the corresponding value is used.
#
# The [SEAMM] section contains options for the SEAMM environment
# itself. On the command line these come before any options for
# plug-ins, which follow the name of the plug-in. The plug-in name is
# also the section in this file for that plug-in.
#
# All other sections are for the plug-ins, and generally have the form
# [xxxxx-step], in lowercase.
#
# Finally, options can refer to options in the same or other sections
# with a syntax like ${section:option}. If the section is omitted,
# the current section and [DEFAULT] are searched, in that
# order. Otherwise the given section and [DEFAULT] are searched.

[DEFAULT]
# Default values for options in any section.

[SEAMM]
# Options for the SEAMM infrastructure.

# The root directory
# root = ~/SEAMM

# The location of the datastore
# datastore = ${root}/Jobs

# The config file for dashboards.
# dashboards = ${root}/dashboards.ini
