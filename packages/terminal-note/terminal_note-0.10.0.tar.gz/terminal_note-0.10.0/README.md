## Motivation
I mostly work in the terminal and use tools like `nvim`, `rg`, `fd`, and `fzf`. For note-taking, I use Obsidian — it stores notes locally in separate `.md` files, which is very convenient. However, launching Obsidian takes time, and constantly switching between the terminal and a GUI application disrupts my workflow.

To stay inside the terminal, I wrote `terminal-note` — a utility that allows you to quickly create, search, and manage notes directly from the console.

## Features
- Create notes with one command without opening an editor.
- Search, open, delete, and read notes using `fzf`.
- Notes are saved in Markdown (`.md`) format.
- Support for templates and flexible configuration through a config file.
- Works with a chosen directory — easily integrates with Obsidian.
- Write notes in your favorite console editor: nvim, micro, and others.


## Installation
1. Install via pip:

```bash
pip install terminal-note --user
```

2. Verify it works:

```bash
tn --help
```


# Usage
- `tn --config` or `tn -c` — open the configuration file.
- `tn "note text"` — create a quick note. The file will be named by a template (`2025-04-05 15:30:00.md`) and saved in the specified directory.
- `tn -o` — create or open a note. First, enter the file name, then the editor opens. If the file exists — it is edited; if not — created.
- `tn -d` — delete a note. The file is selected for deletion via `fzf`.
- `tn -r` — read a note. The file is selected through `fzf` and opened in `frogmouth` (which parses Markdown with navigation support).

# Dependencies

- python >= 3.11
- iterfzf >= 1.8.0.62.0
- frogmouth >= 0.9.2


# Configuration file

```toml
# Storage mode (files only)
storage_mode = "files"

# Path to the directory where notes will be stored.
# The script parses only the $HOME variable. If a special path is needed, specify it fully.
path_to_storage_directory = "$HOME/terminal_note"

# File extension for notes: txt, md (without the dot .md)
file_extension = "md"

# Utility for reading non-md files: bat, cat, less
file_reader = "cat"

# Path to the template file.
path_to_template_note = "$HOME/terminal_note/Templates/template.md"

# Editor to write notes comfortably: vi, vim, nvim, micro, nano, etc.
editor = "vi"
```


### Storage structure

Example storage structure:

```bash

# Ideas

- [ ] Git integration: `tn -g` will perform `pull`, `add`, `commit`, `push`.
- [ ] Support storage in a database (not sure yet — as it breaks compatibility with Obsidian).
- [ ] Possibly store inline quick notes in a separate directory for easier searching.
