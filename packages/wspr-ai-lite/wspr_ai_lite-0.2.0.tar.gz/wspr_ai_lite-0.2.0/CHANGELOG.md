## [0.1.9] - 2025-08-24
### Fixed

- Ensured module docstring placement is compliant with Python‚Äôs `__future__` import rules and pre-commit checks.

### Changed
- `wspr_app.py` is now packaged inside `wspr_ai_lite`, so `wspr-lite ui` works out-of-the-box after `pip install`.

  wspr-lite ui --db ~/wspr-data/wspr.duckdb --port 8501
