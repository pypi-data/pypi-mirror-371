## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.6] - 2025-08-24
### Fixed
- Declared required runtime dependencies (`duckdb`, `streamlit`, etc.) in `pyproject.toml`.
  This ensures the CLI works correctly after a fresh `pip install wspr-ai-lite` without missing imports.

### Improved
- Smoke tests now validate the PyPI wheel by running `wspr-ai-lite ingest` end-to-end,
  verifying dependency resolution and successful data ingestion.
- Documentation versioning refined to pull from `pyproject.toml`, reducing mismatch risk.

[0.2.6]: https://github.com/KI7MT/wspr-ai-lite/compare/v0.2.5...v0.2.6

## [0.2.6] - 2025-08-24
### Added
- **MkDocs macros integration**: Added `docs/_ext/wspr_macros` with build-time macros (project metadata, UTC build time).
- **CI Docs versioning**: GitHub Actions now injects `WSPR_AI_LITE_VERSION` into docs builds for reproducible version output.
- **GitHub Standards**: Added `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `SECURITY.md`, and `.github` templates (issues + PR).

### Changed
- **Docs build pipeline**: Consolidated `make setup-dev` to install all requirements (runtime, dev, docs, pre-commit).
- **Makefile**: Removed brittle heredocs; simplified `docs-serve` and ensured environment injection for docs versioning.
- **Docs navigation**: Adjusted to fix broken references (`CHANGELOG.md`, `LICENSE.md`, etc.).

### Fixed
- **Smoke tests**: Updated `smoke-ui-check` to check for `wspr_ai_lite.py` instead of deprecated `wspr_app.py`.
- **Docs warnings**: Resolved strict build errors due to mismatched filenames and missing references.

## [0.2.5] - 2025-08-24
### Changed
- Fixes a missing link in documentation site

## [0.2.4] - 2025-08-24
### Changed
- Updated wspr_app.py entry point as the file moved from `app/wspr_app.py` to `srv/wspr_ai_lite/wspr_app.py`.
- Cleaned up Makefile to simplify help message.
- Removed docstrings from wspr_ai_lite.py to prevent rendering on landing page.
- Renamed the app entry point `wspr_app.py` to `wspr_ai_lite.py` to prevent potential WSPR app collisions.
- Updated Docs for new entry point `wspr-au-lite`
- Updated Developer documentation.

## [0.2.1] - 2025-08-24
### Changed
- CLI now displays the program name as `wspr-ai-lite` (instead of `wspr-lite`) in `--version` and help output.
- Updated documentation, usage examples, and CHANGELOG to consistently use `wspr-ai-lite` as the canonical command.
- Retained the `wspr-lite` shim for backward compatibility, which continues to emit a deprecation warning.

## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-24
### Changed
- Default CLI command is now `wspr-ai-lite`.
- Added transitional `wspr-ai-lite` shim with deprecation warning.

### Deprecated
- The `wspr-lite` command will be removed in a future release.

## [0.1.9] - 2025-08-24
### Fixed
- Added missing `import os` in `cli.py` (caused `wspr-ai-lite ui` to crash).
- Ensured module docstring placement is compliant with Python‚Äôs `__future__` import rules and pre-commit checks.

### Changed
- `wspr_app.py` is now packaged inside `wspr_ai_lite`, so `wspr-ai-lite ui` works out-of-the-box after `pip install`.
- CLI `ui` subcommand now correctly resolves the installed app path instead of referencing `app/wspr_app.py`.

### Notes
- Users can now launch the dashboard with:
  ```bash
  wspr-ai-lite ui --db ~/wspr-data/wspr.duckdb --port 8501

## [0.1.7] - 2025-08-23
### Fixed
- Fixed `wspr-ai-lite ingest` failures when running from the PyPI package:
- Removed dependency on repo-local `pipelines/` (ingest is now fully self-contained in the package).
- Corrected timestamp handling: UTC ‚Üí naive UTC for DuckDB.
- Fixed DuckDB insert by using `con.register()` for DataFrame ingestion.
- Added Change log to site documents

### Changed
- Internal refactoring of ingest for better portability and reproducibility across platforms.

## [0.1.6] - 2025-08-23
### Added
- Initial PyPI release of `wspr-ai-lite`.
- CLI: `wspr-ai-lite ingest` for pulling and storing WSPRNet monthly archives into DuckDB.
- CLI: `wspr-ai-lite ui` for launching the Streamlit dashboard.
- Documentation site via MkDocs + Material theme.
- Pre-commit hooks and CI workflows for linting, testing, and publishing.
