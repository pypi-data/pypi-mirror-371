## Installation

```bash
pip install ec2-simple-connect
```

## Prerequisites

1. Python 3.7 or higher
2. AWS Account and credentials
3. SSH key pairs for your EC2 instances

## Quick Start

1. Configure your AWS credentials:
```bash
aws configure
```

2. Run EC2 Manager:
```bash
ec2-simple-connect
```

On first run, the tool will guide you through configuration setup.

## Configuration

The tool creates a configuration file at `~/.ec2manager/config.ini` with the following settings:

```ini
[DEFAULT]
ssh_key_path = ~/.ssh
default_region = us-east-1
default_username = ec2-user
security_group_protocol = tcp
security_group_port = 22
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| ssh_key_path | Path to SSH keys directory | ~/.ssh |
| default_region | Default AWS region | us-east-1 |
| default_username | Default SSH username | ec2-user |
| security_group_protocol | Security group protocol | tcp |
| security_group_port | Security group port | 22 |

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. Start the tool:
```bash
ec2-manager
```

2. Select a region from the displayed list

3. Choose an instance to connect to

4. Enter username (or press Enter for default)

### Features in Detail

#### Region Selection
- Lists all available AWS regions
- Remembers last used region
- Easy switching between regions

#### Instance Management
- Lists all instances with details:
  - Instance ID

  - Status
  - Public IP
- Supports starting stopped instances
- Handles instance state transitions

#### Security Group Management
- Automatically manages security group rules
- Adds rules for your current IP
- Removes rules when disconnecting
- Supports custom protocols and ports

#### SSH Connection
- Automatic SSH key selection
- Custom username support
- Handles different instance states
- Secure connection settings

## Security

- Configurations stored in protected directory (`~/.ec2manager`)
- Secure file permissions (600 for config files)
- Temporary security group rules
- No storage of sensitive credentials

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Unable to locate credentials"
- Ensure AWS credentials are configured: `aws configure`
- Check `~/.aws/credentials` exists and has valid credentials

### Issue: "Permission denied (publickey)"
- Verify SSH key exists in configured path
- Check key permissions (should be 600)
- Confirm correct username for instance

### Issue: "Connection timed out"
- Verify security group rules
- Check instance public IP is accessible
- Ensure instance is running
