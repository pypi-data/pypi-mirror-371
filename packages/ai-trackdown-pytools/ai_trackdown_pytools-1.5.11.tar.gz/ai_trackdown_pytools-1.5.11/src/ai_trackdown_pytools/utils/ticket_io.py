"""Utility functions for saving and loading ticket models to/from YAML files.

This module provides simple functions to save and load ticket models directly
to/from YAML files, useful for testing and other scenarios where you need
direct file access without going through TicketManager.

WHY: While TicketManager handles the full workflow with markdown files and frontmatter,
tests and other utilities often need simpler direct YAML serialization for
ticket models. This module provides that functionality.
