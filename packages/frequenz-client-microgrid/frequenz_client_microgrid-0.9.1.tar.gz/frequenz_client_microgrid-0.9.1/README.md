## Introduction

This project provides a Python client for the [Frequenz Microgrid

idiomatic to use in Python than the automatically-generated gRPC client
provided by `protoc`.

## Supported Platforms

The following platforms are officially supported (tested):

- **Python:** 3.11
- **Operating System:** Ubuntu Linux 20.04
- **Architectures:** amd64, arm64
