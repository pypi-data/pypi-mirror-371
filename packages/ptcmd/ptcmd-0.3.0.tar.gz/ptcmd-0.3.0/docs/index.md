`ptcmd` is a Python framework that modernizes command-line interface development by providing declarative command definitions, automatic parameter parsing, and rich interactive features. Built on `prompt_toolkit` and `rich`, it bridges the gap between Python's basic `cmd` module and full-featured CLI frameworks like `cmd2`, offering the best interactive experience with minimal complexity.
