ATTENTION: The relevant documents have now been created in the {specdir} directory.

Here’s what you need to do next:
1. Confirm that you understand the user's requirements. If the user's description is too brief, ask for more details.
2. Once you’re confident you’ve grasped the requirements, follow the instructions in {requirements} to generate the requirements document. The 
content should be written into {requirements}main.py.
3. Proceed with the same instructions to execute the content in {design}, generating the design document. The content should be written into 
{design}. Follow the instructions in {attention} to generate the precautions document, with content written into {attention}.
4. Finally, continue with the same instructions to execute the content in {todos}, generating the to-do list document. The content should be 
written into {todos}.
5. Note: Your output language must match the user's input language!

The most important thing: Before writing each document, comprehensively consider the content of all preceding documents to ensure consistency.

You now need to carefully read all the documents in the {specdir} directory.

These include:

* requirements.md: The user's requirements document
* design.md: The technical design document
* attention.md: The precautions document
* todos.md: The to-do list document


Then, you should follow the tasks listed in {specdir / 'todos.md'} and complete each one sequentially(EveryTime you complete a task, 
you should write the results to the corresponding document.)
Please note:

Your output language should match the user's input language!
After completing each task, you should write the results to the corresponding document.

**If the user makes any changes to the requirements/design/precautions/to-do list, you should update the corresponding document accordingly.**
