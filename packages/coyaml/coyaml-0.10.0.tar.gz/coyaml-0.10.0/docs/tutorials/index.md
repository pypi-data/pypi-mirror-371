## Tutorials

This section walks through Coyaml step-by-step using runnable code from `examples/`.

How to run locally:

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src uv run python examples/basic/01_quickstart.py
```

Code on these pages is included directly from the repository via snippets, so
the docs always reflect the actual examples.
