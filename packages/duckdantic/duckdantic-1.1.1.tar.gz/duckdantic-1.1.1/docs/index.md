## What is Duckdantic?

Duckdantic is a Python library that brings true duck typing to runtime validation. It allows you to define structural types (called **traits**) and check whether objects satisfy them, regardless of their actual type or inheritance hierarchy.

> "If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, then it must be a duck"

With Duckdantic, you can verify this programmatically!

## Key Features

### ü¶Ü True Duck Typing

Check if objects have the right structure, not the right type. Works with any Python object - Pydantic models, dataclasses, TypedDict, plain classes, or even dictionaries.

### üèóÔ∏è Trait-Based Design

Define reusable structural requirements that can be mixed, matched, and composed. Think of traits as "interfaces" that don't require inheritance.

### üöÄ High Performance

Intelligent caching and optimized field normalization ensure your runtime checks don't slow down your application.

### üéØ Flexible Policies

Fine-tune how types are compared with policies that control subclass acceptance, numeric widening, literal handling, and more.

### üîå Seamless Integration

Works perfectly with existing Python typing features. Use traits with `isinstance()`, create ABCs, and integrate with your favorite frameworks.

## Quick Example

```python
from duckdantic import TraitSpec, FieldSpec, satisfies

# Define what a "User" should look like
UserTrait = TraitSpec(
    name="User",
    fields=(
        FieldSpec("id", int, required=True),
        FieldSpec("email", str, required=True),
        FieldSpec("name", str, required=False),
    )
)

# Any object with the right fields satisfies the trait
class Customer:
    def __init__(self, id: int, email: str, company: str):
        self.id = id
        self.email = email
        self.company = company

customer = Customer(1, "alice@example.com", "ACME Corp")
assert satisfies(customer, UserTrait)  # ‚úÖ It's user-like!

# Even dictionaries work
user_dict = {"id": 2, "email": "bob@example.com"}
assert satisfies(user_dict, UserTrait)  # ‚úÖ Also user-like!
```

## Why Duckdantic?

### The Problem

Python's dynamic typing is powerful, but sometimes you need to ensure objects have certain fields or methods at runtime. Traditional approaches require:

- **Inheritance**: Forces rigid hierarchies
- **Type annotations**: Only checked by static analyzers
- **Manual validation**: Tedious and error-prone

### The Solution

Duckdantic provides a clean, Pythonic way to:

- ‚úÖ Validate object structures at runtime
- ‚úÖ Bridge between different frameworks (Pydantic ‚Üî dataclasses ‚Üî TypedDict)
- ‚úÖ Define flexible interfaces without inheritance
- ‚úÖ Build plugin systems with runtime guarantees
- ‚úÖ Test with confidence using structural assertions

## Installation

```bash
pip install duckdantic
```

For Pydantic support:

```bash
pip install "duckdantic[pydantic]"
```
