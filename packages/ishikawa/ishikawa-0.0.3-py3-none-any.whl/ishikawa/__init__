As a Data Science Manager at PGE-PR and a Ph.D. in Computational Modeling
at the Federal University of Juiz de Fora (UFJF), I specialize in artificial
intelligence, focusing on the study, development, and application of fuzzy
inference models. My academic journey includes a scholarship that allowed me
to pursue a year of my Ph.D. at the University of Nottingham/UK, where I was
a member of the LUCID (Laboratory for Uncertainty in Data and Decision Making)
under the supervision of Professor Christian Wagner. My background in Industrial
Engineering provides me with a holistic view of organizational processes,
enabling me to propose efficient solutions and reduce waste.
