# Claude Code Notifier Comprehensive Development Roadmap

## 📋 Project Overview

This roadmap outlines the plan to complete the Claude Code Notifier intelligent rate-limiting system, moving from ~75% completeness to production readiness.

### 🎯 Objectives
- Strengthen the intelligent rate-limiting architecture: real operation blocking and notification throttling
- Improve user experience: intuitive monitoring and control interfaces
- Ensure production stability: robust error handling, monitoring, and recovery
- Enhance scalability: modular architecture for future growth

## ✅ Completed Features (v0.0.3b4)

### 🚀 PyPI Version Claude Code Hook Auto-Configuration System
**Completion Date**: August 21, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ Completed

**Implementation**:
- ✅ **Complete Hook System** - `ClaudeHookInstaller` class provides full lifecycle management
- ✅ **Smart CLI Management** - `claude-notifier setup --auto` and `hooks` command group
- ✅ **Dual-Mode Compatibility** - Smart switching between PyPI and Git installation modes
- ✅ **Auto Environment Detection** - Support for multiple Claude Code installation location detection
- ✅ **Unified User Experience** - Eliminated functional differences between PyPI and Git versions

**Technical Achievements**:
