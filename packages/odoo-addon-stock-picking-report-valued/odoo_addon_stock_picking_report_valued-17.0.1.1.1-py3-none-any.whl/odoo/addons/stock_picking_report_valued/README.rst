Add amount information to Delivery Slip report. You can select at
partner level if picking list report must be valued or not. If the
picking is done it's valued with quantity done, otherwise the picking is
valued with reserved quantity.

Additionally, you can configure each individual picking to be valued or
not, regardless of the partner's configuration. This allows for more
flexibility when generating delivery slips for different purposes or
recipients.
