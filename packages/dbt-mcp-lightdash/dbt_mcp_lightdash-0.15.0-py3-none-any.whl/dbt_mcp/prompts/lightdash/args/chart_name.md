A clear, descriptive name for the chart that explains what it shows. Good chart names help users quickly understand the chart's purpose without opening it.

Best practices for chart names:
- Be specific about what's measured: "Monthly Revenue Trend" not just "Revenue"
- Include time context if relevant: "Q4 2024 Sales by Region"
- Mention key dimensions: "Customer Lifetime Value by Segment"
- Use business terminology your team understands
- Keep it concise but informative (3-6 words typically)

Examples:
- "Daily Active Users - Last 30 Days"
- "Top 10 Products by Revenue"
- "Customer Churn Rate by Month"
- "Regional Sales Performance Comparison"
- "Conversion Funnel - Q4 2024"

Avoid:
- Generic names like "Chart 1" or "Analysis"
- Overly technical names with field IDs
- Names that will become outdated (unless the chart has date filters)
