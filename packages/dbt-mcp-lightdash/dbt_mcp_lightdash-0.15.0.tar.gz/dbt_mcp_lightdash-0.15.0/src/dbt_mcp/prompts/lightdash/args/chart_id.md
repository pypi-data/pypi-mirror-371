The UUID identifier of a specific Lightdash chart. Chart IDs are unique identifiers assigned when a chart is created.

To find chart IDs:
1. Use the `list_charts` tool to see all charts with their IDs
2. Chart IDs are typically shown in Lightdash URLs when viewing a chart
3. Format: UUID string like `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`

You'll need the exact chart ID to:
- Retrieve chart details and configuration
- Update an existing chart
- Delete a chart
- Reference a chart in dashboards
