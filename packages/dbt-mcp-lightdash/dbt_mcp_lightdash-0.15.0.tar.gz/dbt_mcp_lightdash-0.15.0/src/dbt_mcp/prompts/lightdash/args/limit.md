Maximum number of results to return. Use limits to:
- Test queries with small samples before running full queries
- Get top/bottom N results (combined with sorting)
- Improve query performance on large datasets
- Create focused visualizations

Common limit values:
- `5` or `10` - Quick data preview or top items
- `20` to `50` - Detailed analysis while keeping manageable
- `100` - Comprehensive view for dashboards
- `None` or omit - Return all results (use carefully on large datasets)

Best practice: Start with a small limit (5-10) to verify your query returns expected results, then increase or remove the limit for the full dataset.
