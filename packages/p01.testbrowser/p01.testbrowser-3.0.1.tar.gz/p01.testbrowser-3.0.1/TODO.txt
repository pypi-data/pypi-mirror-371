- implement asDomString as asSoupTag and use them in dumpControlToDom


new concept
-----------

review the concept at all and try to get rid of the control wrapping webttest
control concept. Implement a simpler concept where the controls are direct
wrappers of the dom without storing the values in web test controls.


as next
~~~~~~~

- implement

  - controls

   - input, textarea, etc.

  - parser

    - lxml parser

  - browser

    - getControl, etc. api

    - parse dom and wrap them to controls


ideas
-----

- controls

   - should we create controls for any dom element with attr contentEditable?

     - if so, don't submit them as form, but support a json-rpc library for
       andle them as they whould be form elements. This whould be a fancy
       concept for inline content editing
