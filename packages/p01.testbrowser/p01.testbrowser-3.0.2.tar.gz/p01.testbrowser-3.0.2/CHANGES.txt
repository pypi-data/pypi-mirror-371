2.0.0 (2016-06-30)
------------------

- completly changed the concept how the html dom, forms and control get handled.
  The new implementation will setup all forms and controls on any dom changes.
  Any control value changes will get dumped to the html dom and forms and
  controls will get re-created. This means the new implementation will allways
  represent the same state in the dom and any controls. This is not the case
  in most test browser implementations. The main reason for this changes are
  json-rpc requests which probably partial update parts of the dom. This was
  in some uscases a problem and was ending in loosing pre-filled control values
  which didn't get replaced by the reponse (parital inplace dom replacement).

- Keep in mind, that if you get a control with the method getControl and you
  change a value e.g. with getControl('myinput').value = 'something', that the
  dom get changed and you need to get the control again. So don't keep the
  control reference in our test like:

    ctr = getControl('myinput')
    ctr.value = 'foo'
    ctr.value

  Then the ctr reference is outdated since we re-setup the form and controls on
  any dom changes. But anyway, it's not that important since both the old
  control reference (ctr in the sampel above) and the new parsed control which
  you will get with getControl('myinput') will show the same correct value.

- feature: dump all control changes back to dom. This keeps the dom and control
  representation in sync.

- feature: setup all forms and controls on any dom changes. This makes sure that
  if a form get submitted we allways use the latest control values based on the
  dom. Also see the comment about control referencing and dom update above.


1.0.1 (2015-08-16)
------------------

- bugfix: fix control lookup error in WebTestNonFormControls

- bugfix: use browser.node2String for convert to string in form2String,
  widget2String, button2String and link2String

- switch to bootstrap 2


1.0.0 (2015-03-17)
------------------

- feature: implement j01.jsonrpc and j01.dialog button and link controls.
  The current implementation supports the j01.jsonrpc and j01.dialog buttons
  and and links aout of the box. Even the j01 dialog popup is supported.
  This makes jsonrpc based request/repsone testing very simple. There is
  no difference in testing a simple or jsonrpc form anymore.

- feature: support a html5 like browser history implementation using
  pushState and onpopstate like history state management

- feature: support j01.history.js concept given from j01.jsonrpc. Added
  implicit support for this html5 browser history concept based on given
  jsonrpc response. Also support the standard history. You can access
  the history with the method getHistory()

- feature: add activities. You can dump the activities with the method
  getActivities and you will see a nice log like history.

- feature: support more request methods like PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS etc

- feature: added JSONRPCProxy and getJSONRPCTestProxy supporting wsgi
  application setup

- feature: implement better support for ajax injection. Keep original html as
  reference for content injection as browser._dom property and offer a method
  for replace partial content. Also support response.body content as body
  attribute and json method for access application/json response.


0.5.0 (2015-01-20)
------------------

- initial release. Note, this is just a copy of zope.testbrowser version 5.0.0
  for experiment with jsonrpc support for our j01.* packages.
