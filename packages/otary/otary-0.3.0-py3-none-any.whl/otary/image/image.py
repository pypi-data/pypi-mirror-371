        Beware: this method is different from the score_contains method because in
        this case you can emphasize the base image by dilating its content.

        Everything that is a 1 in the rmask will be dilated to give more chance for the
        contour to be contained within the image in the calculation. This way you
        can control the sensitivity of the score.

        Args:
            polygons (Sequence[Polygon]): Polygon object
            dilate_kernel (tuple, optional): dilate kernel param. Defaults to (5, 5).

            resize_factor (float, optional): resize factor that can be adjusted to
                provide extra speed. A lower value will be faster but less accurate.
                Typically 0.5 works well but less can have a negative impact on accuracy
