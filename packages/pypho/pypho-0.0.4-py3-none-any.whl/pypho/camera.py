"""camera.py

Defines Camera and shots manipulations.

This is the main module of the photogrammetric design.
The typical use case would be to
- (optional) define and add the parameters of you camera and lens in the
registry. Note that this is required if it is not already known.
- get a Camera object from the registry (CameraRegistry.get_camera)
- set the configuration of the Camera for both its internal parameters
(e.g., focal length, aperture) and external parameters (location, orientation)
- take a (camera) shot to create a picture

CameraShot (ie., pictures) and Camera both derive from CameraBase, 
which centralises base definitions, such as geometrical aspects.
In essence, the difference between a Camera and a CameraSHot is that
the parameters of a Camera can be modified via different update functions,
while the CameraShot parameters are fixed and defined by the configuration of
the Camera taking the shot when it was taken.

CameraBase provides geometrical objects that can help visualise the Camera and
CameraShot. Those are only computed on demand and will be automatically 
updated when modifying the camera parameters.

    """Stores a registry of Cameras.
    
    This class is a singleton, as there could be only one registry.
    The different cameras definitions are stored in camera_base DataFrame.
    Associated lenses are stored in lense_base DataFrame.
    Cameras are referenced by a unique id (uid) and a human-readable name.

    Methods:
    - CameraRegistry.register_camera: to register a new camera
    - CameraRegistry.register_lens: to register a new lens 
    (this can be avoided and simple parameters of the lens can be passed when needed)
    - CameraRegistry.camera_base: stores and gives access to the camera definitions
    - CameraRegistry.lens_base: stores and gives access to the lense definitions
    - CameraRegistry.get_camera: to create an instance of a given camera (and lens)

    The information stored are:
    - uid: a unique identifier
    - name: a human-readable name
    - sensor_width: the width of the sensor in mm
    - sensor_height: the height of the sensor in mm
    - nb_pixel_width: the number of pixels in width direction
    - nb_pixel_height: the number of pixels in height direction
    Other information are computed:
    - pixel_pitch: the pitch (i.e., distance from one pixel center to the next)
    of the pixels on the sensor in mm
    - nb_pixel: the definition of the sensor, i.e., the number of pixels
    - MPix: the definition in mega pixels
    A new instance of Camera can then be created by the getter get_camera()
