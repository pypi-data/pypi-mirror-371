"""target.py

This module provides objects that represents the target of the photographies.
They heavily rely on pyvista for the geometrical definition of objects.

More complex examples of objects and textures are also provided:
- get_pebble_dataset: creates and return a dataset that represents 
a small pebble-shaped rock sample.
- get_rock_texture: returns a simple pyvista texture that somewhat looks
like rock.
