This module prevents automatic updates to the addresses in Field Service
orders once they are completed. It helps preserve the original location
data, even if the customer's address changes later.

Ideal for maintaining historical accuracy and traceability in field
service operations.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::
   :local:

Usage
=====

- Verify existing orders

  - Open an existing order (e.g., a demo fsm.order).
  - Confirm that the address fields are filled with values from the
    linked fsm.location.

- Confirm one order and modify the location

  - Click on Complete button for complete the order
  - Go to the corresponding fsm.location and change its address fields
    (e.g., change phone or city).
  - Return to the fsm.order: the order's address fields should remain
    unchanged.
