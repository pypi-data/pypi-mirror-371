"""
Classifies: Short‐chain fatty acid.

Definition:
  "An aliphatic monocarboxylic acid with a chain length of less than C6.
   If any non‐hydrocarbon substituent is present, the compound is not normally regarded as a short‐chain fatty acid."

Our implementation requires that:
  – the molecule is acyclic,
  – exactly one carboxylic acid group is present (identified by the SMARTS "[CX3](=O)[OX2H]"),
  – the carboxyl (acid) carbon is terminal in the carbon–only connectivity,
  – all oxygens in the molecule appear in that group (i.e. total oxygen count is exactly 2),
  – the total number of carbons is at least 3 and at most 6, and
  – if the acid is unbranched (i.e. the longest continuous carbon chain that includes the carboxyl carbon matches the total carbon count)
    then acids with 6 carbons (n–hexanoic acid) are rejected.
    
Note:
  In many common cases, short–chain fatty acids are branched or contain an alkene function. To discriminate them from
  unbranched acids we compute the longest path from the carboxyl carbon (in the carbon–only graph) and require that if the
  acid is completely linear then its total carbon count must be less than 6.

    Determines if a molecule qualifies as a short-chain fatty acid.
    
    A qualifying short-chain fatty acid is defined as:
      (a) an acyclic, aliphatic molecule,
      (b) containing exactly one carboxylic acid group (SMARTS: "[CX3](=O)[OX2H]"),
      (c) where the acid carbon is terminal (i.e. attached to exactly one carbon in the C–only graph),
      (d) all heteroatoms (here oxygens) are only those in the COOH group,
      (e) the total number of carbons in the molecule is between 3 and 6 (inclusive),
      (f) but if the molecule is unbranched – that is, the longest continuous carbon chain (starting from the carboxyl carbon)
          covers every carbon in the molecule – then a 6–carbon acid (i.e. n–hexanoic acid) is not allowed.

                 '“false positives” were molecules that have exactly one '
                 'carboxyl group, no extra heteroatoms, and satisfy the '
                 '“global” carbon‐count restriction (3–6 total carbons) but '
                 'are unbranched (that is, the longest continuous carbon chain '
                 'including the –COOH is as long as the whole molecule). In '
                 'practice, many “normal” short‐chain fatty acids are branched '
                 '(for example, (R)–2‐methylbutyric acid or 2–methylvaleric '
                 'acid). In contrast, unbranched acids (n–hexanoic acid is one '
                 'example) exceed the “short‐chain” definition even if they '
                 'have the right total number of carbons. One can thus improve '
                 'the algorithm by computing the longest path through the '
                 'carbon–only graph (starting at the carboxyl carbon) and '

                 'longest path equals the total number of carbon atoms) and '
