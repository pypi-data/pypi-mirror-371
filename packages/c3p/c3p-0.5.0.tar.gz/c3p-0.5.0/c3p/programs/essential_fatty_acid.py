                 'matches a carbon connected to an oxygen double bond and an '
                 'oxygen with one hydrogen (the hydroxyl). However, in some '
                 'cases, the hydroxyl might be deprotonated (like in a salt), '

                 "the SMARTS wouldn't match. But the examples provided in the "

                 'acid ends with CCCCC(O)=O, which is COOH. So the SMARTS '
                 'should match. But perhaps in some cases, the code fails to '

                 'Another issue is that the code checks for exactly two oxygen '
                 'atoms. But if the molecule has more oxygens (like in an '
                 "ester or other groups), it would be rejected. That's "
                 'correct. So in the false positives, like "Clupadonic acid" '
