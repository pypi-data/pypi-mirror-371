                 '\n'
                 'Wait, aldoximes are derived from aldehydes, which have '

                 'carbon) should have only one other carbon attached (since '

                 'maybe the carbon in the aldoxime group (C=N-OH) should have '

                 'In the false positives like pralidoxime, the structure is '
                 'probably a pyridine derivative where the carbon adjacent to '

                 "the code's previous pattern allowed carbons with degree 2 "

                 "that's impossible in an aldoxime. So perhaps the D1 was "
                 'incorrect, leading to false positives where the carbon is '

                 'Testing this: for example, in pralidoxime mesylate (SMILES: '

                 'ring has alternating double bonds. So in pralidoxime, the '
                 'aldoxime group is attached as a substituent. The SMILES is '

                 'N (from the pyridine ring) and the N in the oxime. So degree '
                 'would be 2. Hmm, maybe the previous SMARTS would still '
