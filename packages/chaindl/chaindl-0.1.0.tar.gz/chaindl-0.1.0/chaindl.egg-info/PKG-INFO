`chaindl` is a lightweight Python library that lets you fetch historical and live on-chain crypto data from multiple 
public sources in one step. Whether you want to analyze metrics from Bitcoin, Ethereum, or other chains, `chaindl` 
handles the heavy lifting so you can focus on insights.

## Why Use `chaindl`?

- **Fetch crypto on-chain data in one line** – no need for API keys or complicated setups.

- **Save and share** – easily export data as CSV for offline use, Excel, or reporting.  
- **Multiple sources supported** – from Cryptoquant to CheckOnChain, get all your metrics without juggling different platforms.  
- **Focus on insights, not boilerplate** – `chaindl` handles parsing and formatting, so you spend less time on setup.
