This `fixtures` directory contains a variety of test sets, including sequence data and intermediate files, intended for use and testing with pyANI-plus. Each test set includes separate `README.md` file that provides detailed context for each case.

There will typically be two subdirectories:
- `intermediates`: contains intermediate files expected to be generated by the ANI methods (e.g., `.filter` and `.delta` files for `ANIm`).
- `matrices`: includes the expected TSV matrix outputs for each ANI method implemented.
