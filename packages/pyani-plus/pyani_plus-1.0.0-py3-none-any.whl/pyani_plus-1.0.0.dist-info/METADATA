## Documentation

See [pyANI-plus documentation](https://pyani-plus.github.io/pyani-plus-docs/) including [Walkthrough: A First Analysis](https://pyani-plus.github.io/pyani-plus-docs/walkthrough.html).

## Installation

See our [full installation instructions](https://pyani-plus.github.io/pyani-plus-docs/installation.html) for more details. In brief, if you are using `conda` we recommend
[`pyani-plus` from the BioConda channel](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/pyani-plus),
which will include all the dependencies. Otherwise, we recommend installing [`pyani-plus`
from the Python Package Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/pyani-plus/),
and install the non-python tools as needed.

If you would like to use the in-progress development version, please follow the usual installation procedure for GitHub repositories, e.g.

1. Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:pyani-plus/pyani-plus.git`
2. Change directory to the repository: `cd pyani-plus`
3. Create a new conda environment called `pyani-plus_py312` using the command `make setup_conda_env` (there is a corresponding `remove_conda_env` target)
4. Activate the conda environment with the command `conda activate pyani-plus_py312`
5. Install using one of the following methods:
   1.  `pip`, e.g.: `pip install -U -e .`
   2.  `Make`, e.g.: `make install_macos` or `make install_linux`
