## 📦 Installation

Install via pip:

```bash
pip install dustmaps3d
```

## 📦 Data File Instructions

> ⚠️ The package **does not include the data file**. A ~400MB model file will be automatically downloaded on first use from GitHub or NADC.

### 🚀 Auto Download Mechanism

- When `dustmaps3d()` is called, it will try to download `data_v3.fits.gz`;
- After download, it will automatically extract the file to `data_v3.fits` and cache it locally;
- On future runs, the file will be read from the local cache without re-downloading.

- ✅ For international users, the primary source is: [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/Grapeknight/dustmaps3d/releases)
- 🌀 If GitHub download fails, it will automatically fallback to: [NADC Data Center](https://nadc.china-vo.org/res/file_upload/download?id=51939)

> On Chinese systems, the order is reversed — NADC is used as the primary source.

### 🌐 What if download fails?

If download fails (e.g. `connect timeout`), you can manually download and place the file in the cache directory:

1. Visit one of the following links:  
   🇨🇳 [NADC Data Center (for China)](https://nadc.china-vo.org/res/r101662/)  
   🌍 [GitHub Releases (global)](https://github.com/Grapeknight/dustmaps3d/releases)

2. Download: `data_v3.fits.gz`
3. Extract to: `data_v3.fits`
4. Place the extracted file in the local cache directory (the location is printed on first use)

> Example path (Windows):  
> `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\dustmaps3d\data_v3.fits`

> Example path (Linux/macOS):  
> `/home/<username>/.local/share/dustmaps3d/data_v3.fits`

## 🚀 Usage

```python
from dustmaps3d import dustmaps3d

l = [120.0]
b = [30.0]
d = [1.5]

EBV, dust, sigma, max_d = dustmaps3d(l, b, d)
print(f"EBV: {EBV.values[0]:.4f} [mag]")
print(f"Dust: {dust.values[0]:.4f} [mag/kpc]")
print(f"Sigma: {sigma.values[0]:.4f} [mag]")
print(f"Max distance: {max_d.values[0]:.4f} kpc")

```

**Batch example with FITS:**

```python
import numpy as np
from astropy.table import Table
from dustmaps3d import dustmaps3d

data = Table.read('input.fits')   
l = data['l'].astype(float)
b = data['b'].astype(float)
d = data['d'].astype(float)

EBV, dust, sigma, max_d = dustmaps3d(l, b, d)

data['EBV_3d'] = EBV
data['dust'] = dust
data['sigma'] = sigma
data['max_distance'] = max_d
data.write('output.fits', overwrite=True)
```

## ⚙️ Tips for Advanced Users

To ensure broad compatibility and ease of use, the official `dustmaps3d` package makes certain design trade-offs that may come at the cost of peak performance.

If you have higher performance needs — such as support for multi-processing, command-line usage, or faster data loading and I/O — consider using the alternative implementation by [SunnyHina](https://github.com/SunnyHina):

👉 High-performance version: [SunnyHina/dustmaps3d](https://github.com/SunnyHina/dustmaps3d)

This version adopts a more modern data loading architecture and is better suited for advanced users working with large-scale or batch processing workflows.

## 🧠 Function Description

### `dustmaps3d(l, b, d, n_process=None)`

Estimates 3D dust extinction and related quantities for given galactic coordinates and distances.

| Input       | Type         | Description                        | Unit     |
|-------------|--------------|------------------------------------|----------|
| `l`         | np.ndarray   | Galactic longitude                 | degrees  |
| `b`         | np.ndarray   | Galactic latitude                  | degrees  |
| `d`         | np.ndarray   | Distance                           | kpc      |

#### Returns:

| Output       | Type         | Description                           | Unit     |
|--------------|--------------|---------------------------------------|----------|
| `EBV`        | np.ndarray   | E(B–V) extinction                     | mag      |
| `dust`       | np.ndarray   | Dust density (d(EBV)/dx)             | mag/kpc  |
| `sigma`      | np.ndarray   | Estimated uncertainty in E(B–V)      | mag      |
| `max_d`      | np.ndarray   | Maximum reliable distance            | kpc      |

> If `d` contains `NaN`, it will be automatically replaced by the maximum reliable distance along that line of sight (`max_d`).
> 
> If the input `d` exceeds `max_d`, it indicates the point lies beyond the model's reliable range. The returned values in this case are extrapolated and **not guaranteed to be accurate**.
