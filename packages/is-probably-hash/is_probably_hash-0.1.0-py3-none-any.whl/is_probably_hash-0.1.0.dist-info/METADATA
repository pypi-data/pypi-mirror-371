# is_probably_hash

## Description

`is_probably_hash` is a lightweight Python library to check if particular string can be a hash. Just put particular string, and it will return boolean. Note that when it returns `true`, it means the string is possibly valid hash, but not necessarily must be hash.

Support popular hashes like MD5, SHA1, SHA256, and SHA512. Submit issue or PR for more support. 

## Installation
```bash
pip install is_probably_hash

```

Or install directly from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yogski/is_probably_hash.git

pip install .
```
