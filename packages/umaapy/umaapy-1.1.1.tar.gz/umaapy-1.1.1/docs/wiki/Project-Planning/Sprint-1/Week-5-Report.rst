Weekly Progress Report 5
========================

**Project Name:** UMAAPy

**Sprint #:** 1

**Reporting Period:** 06.09.25â€“06.15.25

**Date of Report:** 06.15.25

**Prepared By:** Devon Reed

1. High-Level Summary
---------------------

In the last iteration of sprint 1, the focus has been to get the final
touches on the CICD pipeline fully completed, which included python
package publishing and docker hub registry usage. Both of these tasks
have been completed as planned for sprint 1. Lastly, source code
development has finally begun with the implementation of the first big
algorithmic piece of the SDK, the ``EventProcessor``. This thread pool
implementation will serve as the beating heart of the SDK, ensuring
maximum throughput and low latency.

3.4. Burndown Chart
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All open issues were resolved by the end of the sprint, with the
majority of tasks sitting in merge request just needing to be tied in
together with the main pipeline.

4. Software Testing
-------------------

4.1. Acceptance Criteria Defined
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

No new acceptance criteria was added this sprint iteration.

4.2. Test Case Specification (Incremental)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

6 test cases were added this week to supplement the final 2 issues that
were still open on this sprint. See the full list below:

Test cases for #17:

- #38
- #39
- #40

Test cases for #18:

- #35
- #36
- #37

4.3. Traceability Matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below is the final traceability matrix for the entire sprint. All test
cases were successfully executed and tracked as Gitlab tasks. The
majority of the early sprint test cases were user acceptance tests or
system tests, since the main priority was focused on setting up project
infrastructure. In the last iteration of the sprint with automated unit
testing and code coverage online, the first key component of the SDK was
built and tested using pytest.
