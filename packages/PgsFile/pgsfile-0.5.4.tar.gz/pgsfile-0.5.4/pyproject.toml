description = "This module streamlines Python package management, script execution, file handling, web scraping, and multimedia downloads. It supports LLM-based NLP tasks like OCR, tokenization, lemmatization, POS tagging, NER, ATE, dependency parsing, MDD, WSD, LIWC, MIP analysis, text classification, and Chinese-English sentence alignment. Additionally, it generates word lists and data visualizations, making it a practical tool for data scraping and analysisâ€”ideal for literary students and researchers."
