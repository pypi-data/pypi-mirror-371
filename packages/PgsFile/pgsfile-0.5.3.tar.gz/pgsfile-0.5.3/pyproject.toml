description = "This module simplifies Python package management, script execution, file handling, web scraping, and multimedia downloads. The module supports (LLM-based) NLP tasks such as OCR, tokenization, lemmatization, POS tagging, NER, ATE, dependency parsing, MDD, WSD, LIWC, MIP analysis and Chinese-English sentence alignment. It also generates word lists, and plots data, aiding literary students. Ideal for scraping data, cleaning text, and analyzing language, it offers user-friendly tools to streamline workflows."
