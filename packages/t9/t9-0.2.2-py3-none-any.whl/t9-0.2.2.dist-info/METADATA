# ☎️  T9

This is a T9 implementation that I wrote a long, long time ago for XBMC
so chat programs could chat via the remote like I could on my Nokia
phone.

That time has long passed, but the other day I was annoyed with how
ugly it is to enter text on my Samsung Smart TV. They're still using
an alphabetical keyboard, the remote doesn't have letters on it.

The language files are huge, but it's organised so the number of reads
depends on the number of buttons pressed. It's pretty fast, and uses
virtually no RAM or CPU. This is required for embedded systems, so
enjoy.

The reader consists of 3 classes, a database node (T9Key), a database
client (T9Dict), and an input parser (T9Input). As a user you'll only
need to bother with the latter.

See demo.py for a good example (works best in a shell), keys are 0-9,
UDLR (navigation) and S (select mode). You'll need loads of RAM the first
time you run it, after it's made the DB it'll need hardly any.

## Language files wanted!

* 🇬🇧 en-GB: Downloaded from the web, derived from gnu aspell (iirc)
* 🇺🇸 en-US: From the system american-english wordlist
* 🇳🇱 nl-NL: Thanks to Breght Boschker for submitting these :)

To make your own dictionary, have a read of maket9.py.
Keep your wordlists though - the file format might change in future.
