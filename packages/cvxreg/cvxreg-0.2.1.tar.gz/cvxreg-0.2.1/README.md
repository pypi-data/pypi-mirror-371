**cvxreg** is a Python package for machine learning with convex regression models built on [`CVXPY`](https://www.cvxpy.org). 

The core aims of this package are:
* make convex regression models "easy to call" from Python,
* interface with [`CVXPY`](https://www.cvxpy.org),
* focus on a "machine learning" perspective, i.e.: predictive task, hyper-parameters should be obtained by a data-driven method such as cross-validation.
