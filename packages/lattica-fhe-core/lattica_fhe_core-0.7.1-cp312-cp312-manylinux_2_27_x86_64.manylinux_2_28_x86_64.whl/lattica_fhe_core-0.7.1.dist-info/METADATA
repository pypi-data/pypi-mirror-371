# lattica-fhe-core

Python bindings for Lattica's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) core library.

## Installation

```bash
pip install lattica-fhe-core
```

## Overview

This package provides low-level Python bindings to Lattica's FHE core C++ library, enabling homomorphic encryption operations on encrypted data. 
It is primarily used as a dependency for higher-level Lattica libraries.

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.10
- Linux x86_64 or macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel)
- Pre-built binaries are included - no compilation required

## Usage

This package is typically not used directly. Instead, use Lattica's higher-level library:
- `lattica-query` - For encrypted query processing and client-side operations

## Example

```python
import lattica_fhe_core

# The package exposes low-level FHE operations
# See Lattica's documentation for complete usage examples
```
