## Implementation Summary

### Critical Fixes Completed (P0 Issues)

All critical P0 issues have been successfully resolved with production-ready implementations:

#### Token Refresh Deadlock Prevention
**File**: `src/project_x_py/realtime/connection_management.py`
- **Issue**: JWT token refresh could cause indefinite blocking and deadlocks
- **Solution**: Timeout-based reconnection with connection state recovery
- **Key Implementation**:
  ```python
  async def update_jwt_token(self, new_jwt_token: str, timeout: float = 30.0) -> bool:
      # Acquire connection lock with timeout to prevent deadlock
      async with asyncio.timeout(timeout):
          async with self._connection_lock:
              # Store original state for recovery
              original_token = self.jwt_token
              # ... perform token update with rollback on failure
  ```
- **Safety Mechanisms**: 
  - 30-second default timeout prevents indefinite waiting
  - Automatic rollback to original connection state on failure
  - Connection state recovery preserves subscriptions
  - Comprehensive error handling with cleanup

#### Task Lifecycle Management
**File**: `src/project_x_py/utils/task_management.py`
- **Issue**: AsyncIO tasks were not properly tracked, causing memory leaks
- **Solution**: Centralized task management with automatic cleanup
- **Key Implementation**:
  ```python
  class TaskManagerMixin:
      def _create_task(self, coro, name=None, persistent=False):
          task = asyncio.create_task(coro)
          self._managed_tasks.add(task)  # WeakSet for automatic cleanup
          if persistent:
              self._persistent_tasks.add(task)  # Critical tasks
          task.add_done_callback(self._task_done_callback)
  ```
- **Safety Mechanisms**:
  - WeakSet-based tracking prevents memory leaks
  - Persistent task support for critical background processes
  - Automatic error collection and logging
  - Graceful cancellation with configurable timeouts

#### Race Condition Prevention
**File**: `src/project_x_py/realtime_data_manager/data_processing.py`
- **Issue**: Concurrent bar updates could corrupt data across timeframes
- **Solution**: Fine-grained locking with atomic transactions
- **Key Implementation**:
  ```python
  class DataProcessingMixin:
      def __init__(self):
          # Fine-grained locks per timeframe
          self._timeframe_locks = defaultdict(asyncio.Lock)
          self._update_transactions = {}  # Rollback support
          
      async def _update_timeframe_data_atomic(self, tf_key, timestamp, price, volume):
          tf_lock = self._get_timeframe_lock(tf_key)
          async with tf_lock:
              # Store original state for rollback
              transaction_id = f"{tf_key}_{timestamp.timestamp()}"
              self._update_transactions[transaction_id] = {...}
              # Perform atomic update with rollback on failure
  ```
- **Safety Mechanisms**:
  - Per-timeframe locks prevent cross-timeframe contention
  - Atomic transactions with automatic rollback
  - Rate limiting prevents excessive update frequency
  - Partial failure handling with state recovery

#### Buffer Overflow Handling
**File**: `src/project_x_py/realtime_data_manager/memory_management.py`
- **Issue**: High-frequency data could cause memory overflow
- **Solution**: Dynamic buffer sizing with intelligent sampling
- **Key Implementation**:
  ```python
  async def _handle_buffer_overflow(self, timeframe: str, utilization: float):
      # Trigger alerts at 95% capacity
      if utilization >= 95.0:
          await self._apply_data_sampling(timeframe)
          
  async def _apply_data_sampling(self, timeframe: str):
      # Intelligent sampling: keep 30% recent, sample 70% older
      target_size = int(self.max_bars_per_timeframe * 0.7)
      recent_data_size = int(target_size * 0.3)
      # Preserve recent data, sample older data intelligently
  ```
- **Safety Mechanisms**:
  - Per-timeframe buffer thresholds (5K/2K/1K based on timeframe)
  - 95% utilization triggers for overflow detection
  - Intelligent sampling preserves data integrity
  - Callback system for overflow notifications

### Performance Improvements

The implemented fixes provide significant performance and reliability improvements:

1. **Memory Leak Prevention**: TaskManagerMixin prevents AsyncIO task accumulation
2. **Deadlock Prevention**: Timeout-based token refresh eliminates blocking
3. **Data Integrity**: Fine-grained locking ensures consistent OHLCV data
4. **Memory Efficiency**: Dynamic buffer sizing handles high-frequency data
5. **Error Recovery**: Comprehensive rollback mechanisms maintain system stability

### Configuration Options

New configuration options added for production tuning:

```python
# Token refresh timeout
await realtime_client.update_jwt_token(new_token, timeout=45.0)

# Buffer overflow thresholds
manager.configure_dynamic_buffer_sizing(
    enabled=True,
    initial_thresholds={
        "1min": 2000,  # 2K bars for minute data
        "5min": 1000,  # 1K bars for 5-minute data
    }
)

# Task cleanup timeout
await manager._cleanup_tasks(timeout=10.0)
```

### Migration Notes

No breaking changes were introduced. All fixes are backward compatible:
- Existing code continues to work without modification
- New safety mechanisms are enabled by default
- Configuration options are optional with sensible defaults
- Comprehensive logging helps with debugging and monitoring
