## Detailed Component Analysis

### 1. BaseStatisticsTracker (`base.py`) ✅ **EXCELLENT**

**Architecture Compliance:**
- ✅ 100% async methods with proper `async def` declarations
- ✅ Single `asyncio.Lock` per component prevents deadlocks
- ✅ TTL caching with configurable timeout (5-second default)
- ✅ Circular buffer for error history (deque with maxlen)

**Key Features Implemented:**
- **Async-safe counters and gauges** with proper lock protection
- **Performance timing tracking** with memory limit enforcement (1000 entries)
- **Error tracking** with circular buffer and detailed context
- **Health scoring algorithm** using weighted factors:
  - Error rate (40% weight)
  - Uptime (20% weight) 
  - Activity (20% weight)
  - Status (20% weight)
- **Memory usage estimation** with component-specific calculations
- **TTL cache** with automatic cleanup and expiration

**Code Quality:**
```python
# Excellent async lock usage pattern
async def increment(self, metric: str, value: int | float = 1) -> None:
    async with self._lock:
        self._counters[metric] += value
        self.last_activity = time.time()
```

**Performance Optimizations:**
- Memory-bounded data structures (1000 timing entries max)
- Efficient cache invalidation
- Lock-free operations where possible
- Proper async context management

### 2. ComponentCollector (`collector.py`) ✅ **EXCELLENT**

**Parallel Collection Implementation:**
- ✅ Concurrent collection using `asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)`
- ✅ Graceful error handling - failed components don't stop collection
- ✅ Comprehensive component-specific metric extraction
- ✅ Derived metric calculations (fill rates, win rates, performance ratios)

**Component Coverage:**
- **OrderManager**: Order lifecycle, fill rates, volume metrics
- **PositionManager**: P&L analysis, risk metrics, performance ratios  
- **RealtimeDataManager**: Data throughput, latency, storage metrics
- **OrderBook**: Market microstructure, spread analysis, pattern detection
- **RiskManager**: Risk assessment, rule violations, managed trades

**Robust Error Handling:**
```python
results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)

for i, (name, result) in enumerate(zip(component_names, results, strict=False)):
    if isinstance(result, Exception):
        await self.track_error(result, f"Failed to collect {name} statistics")
        # Continue with other components
    elif result is not None:
        stats[name] = result
```

**Type Safety:**
All return types use proper TypedDict definitions ensuring compile-time safety and runtime validation.

### 3. StatisticsAggregator (`aggregator.py`) ✅ **EXCELLENT**

**Cross-Component Aggregation:**
- ✅ Parallel component collection with timeout protection (1 second per component)
- ✅ Cross-component metrics calculation (total errors, combined P&L)
- ✅ Health score aggregation with weighted averages
- ✅ TTL caching for expensive operations (5-second default)

**Deadlock Prevention:**
- Single `_component_lock` for registration operations
- No nested locking between aggregator and components
- Timeout protection prevents hanging on failed components

**Performance Features:**
```python
# Parallel collection reduces total time to max component time
tasks = [self._collect_component_stats(name, component) for name, component in components]
results = await asyncio.wait_for(
    asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True),
    timeout=self.component_timeout * len(components)
)
```

**Backward Compatibility:**
Excellent compatibility layer for TradingSuite v3.2.x integration with automatic component registration.

### 4. HealthMonitor (`health.py`) ✅ **EXCELLENT**

**Multi-Factor Health Scoring:**
- ✅ **Error Rates** (25% weight): Lower error rates = higher scores
- ✅ **Performance** (20% weight): Response times, latency, throughput
- ✅ **Connection Stability** (20% weight): WebSocket connections, reconnections
- ✅ **Resource Usage** (15% weight): Memory, CPU, API calls
- ✅ **Data Quality** (15% weight): Validation errors, data gaps
- ✅ **Component Status** (5% weight): Active, connected, etc.

**Alert System:**
- **HEALTHY** (80-100): All systems operating normally
- **WARNING** (60-79): Minor issues detected, monitoring recommended
- **DEGRADED** (40-59): Significant issues, intervention suggested
- **CRITICAL** (0-39): System failure risk, immediate action required

**Configurable Thresholds:**
```python
@dataclass
class HealthThresholds:
    error_rate_excellent: float = 1.0  # < 0.1% error rate
    error_rate_good: float = 5.0       # < 0.5% error rate
    response_time_excellent: float = 100.0  # < 100ms
    memory_usage_excellent: float = 50.0    # < 50% memory usage
```

**Actionable Alerts:**
Each alert includes specific recommendations for resolution, making the system genuinely useful for operations.

### 5. StatsExporter (`export.py`) ✅ **EXCELLENT**

**Multiple Export Formats:**
- ✅ **JSON**: Pretty-printed with timestamp support
- ✅ **Prometheus**: Standard metrics format with proper labels
- ✅ **CSV**: Tabular data with component breakdown
- ✅ **Datadog**: API-ready format with tags and series

**Data Sanitization:**
```python
SENSITIVE_FIELDS: ClassVar[set[str]] = {
    "account_id", "account_number", "token", "api_key", 
    "password", "secret", "auth_token", "session_token"
}
```

Proper sanitization prevents sensitive data leakage in exports.

**Format-Specific Optimizations:**
- Prometheus label sanitization for compliance
- CSV hierarchical data flattening
- Datadog metric type mapping (gauge, counter)

### 6. Type Definitions (`stats_types.py`) ✅ **EXCELLENT**

**Comprehensive Type Coverage:**
- ✅ 15+ TypedDict definitions for all components
- ✅ Hierarchical structure with proper inheritance
- ✅ Optional fields using `NotRequired` for flexibility
- ✅ Clear documentation for each field

**Type Safety Benefits:**
```python
class OrderManagerStats(TypedDict):
    orders_placed: int
    orders_filled: int
    fill_rate: float  # orders_filled / orders_placed
    avg_fill_time_ms: float
    # ... 15+ more fields with clear types
```

## Performance Analysis ✅ **EXCELLENT**

### Memory Management
- **Circular buffers** prevent unbounded memory growth
- **TTL caching** with automatic cleanup
- **Sliding windows** for data retention (1K bars per timeframe)
- **Memory estimation** methods for monitoring usage

### Concurrency Optimizations

```python
@pytest.mark.asyncio
async def test_concurrent_statistics_access(self):
    """Test concurrent access to statistics components."""
    # Runs 4 concurrent tasks updating/reading stats
    # Verifies data integrity after concurrent access
    assert tracker._counters["concurrent_counter"] == 200
```

### Minor Test Issue Found ⚠️
