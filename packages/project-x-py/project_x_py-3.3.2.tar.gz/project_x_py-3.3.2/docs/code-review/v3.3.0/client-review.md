### 🔧 Minor Improvements Recommended

#### 1. Enhanced Error Context (Priority: Low)
```python
# Current in http.py line 297-302
if response.status_code == 404:
    raise ProjectXDataError(
        format_error_message(
            ErrorMessages.API_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND, resource=endpoint
        )
    )

# Suggested: Add response body for debugging
if response.status_code == 404:
    try:
        error_details = response.json()
    except Exception:
        error_details = {"text": response.text[:200]}
    
    raise ProjectXDataError(
        format_error_message(
            ErrorMessages.API_RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND, 
            resource=endpoint,
            details=error_details
        )
    )
```

#### 2. Cache Statistics Enhancement (Priority: Low)
```python
# Add to cache.py get_cache_stats method
"hit_ratio": self.cache_hit_count / (self.cache_hit_count + api_call_count) if api_call_count > 0 else 0,
"memory_usage_mb": (len(self._opt_market_data_cache) * 1024) / (1024 * 1024),  # Approximate
```

#### 3. Connection Health Monitoring (Priority: Low)
```python
# Add to http.py
async def get_connection_health(self) -> dict[str, Any]:
    """Get detailed connection pool statistics."""
    if not self._client:
        return {"status": "not_initialized"}
    
    return {
        "is_closed": self._client.is_closed,
        "active_connections": len(self._client._transport.get_pool_stats()) if hasattr(self._client._transport, 'get_pool_stats') else "unknown",
        "http2_enabled": self._client._transport.http2,
    }
```

### 🧪 Testing Gaps Analysis

#### Excellent Test Coverage Areas:
- Basic client initialization and authentication
- HTTP request/response handling
- Error scenarios and exception mapping
- Cache serialization/deserialization

#### Recommended Additional Tests:
1. **Rate Limiting Edge Cases**: Test concurrent requests hitting rate limits
2. **Token Refresh Race Conditions**: Multiple concurrent requests during token expiry
3. **Cache Compression Scenarios**: Large DataFrames exceeding compression threshold
4. **Connection Pool Exhaustion**: High concurrency scenarios
5. **WebSocket Fallback Logic**: Market data fallback scenarios
