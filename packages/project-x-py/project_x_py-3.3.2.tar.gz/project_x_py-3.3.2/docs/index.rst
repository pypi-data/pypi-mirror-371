**project-x-py** is a high-performance **async Python SDK** for the `ProjectX Trading Platform <https://www.projectx.com/>`_ Gateway API. This library enables developers to build sophisticated trading strategies and applications by providing comprehensive async access to futures trading operations, real-time market data, Level 2 orderbook analysis, and a complete technical analysis suite with 58+ TA-Lib compatible indicators including pattern recognition.

.. note::
   **Version 3.2.0**: Major type system improvements with comprehensive TypedDict and Protocol definitions for better IDE support and type safety. Features new StatsTrackingMixin for error and memory tracking, standardized deprecation system, and dramatically improved type checking (reduced errors from 100+ to 13). Includes 47 new tests for complete type system coverage. Fully backward compatible with v3.1.x.

.. note::
   **Stable Production Release**: Since v3.1.1, this project maintains strict semantic versioning with backward compatibility between minor versions. Breaking changes only occur in major version releases (4.0.0+). Deprecation warnings are provided for at least 2 minor versions before removal.

.. note::
   **Important**: This is a **client library/SDK**, not a trading strategy. It provides the tools and infrastructure to help developers create their own trading strategies that integrate with the ProjectX platform.

Quick Start
-----------

Install the package::

   uv add project-x-py

Or with pip::

   pip install project-x-py

Set up your credentials::

   export PROJECT_X_API_KEY='your_api_key'
   export PROJECT_X_USERNAME='your_username'

Start trading::

   import asyncio
   from project_x_py import TradingSuite
   from project_x_py.indicators import RSI, SMA, MACD
   
   async def main():
       # V3.1: Use unified TradingSuite for simplified initialization
       suite = await TradingSuite.create(
           instrument="MNQ",
           timeframes=["1min", "5min"],
           features=["orderbook", "risk_manager"]
       )
       
       # Get market data with technical analysis
       data = await suite.client.get_bars('MNQ', days=30, interval=60)
       data = RSI(data, period=14)         # Add RSI
       data = SMA(data, period=20)         # Add moving average
       data = MACD(data)                   # Add MACD
       
       # Place an order using the integrated order manager
       response = await suite.orders.place_limit_order(
           contract_id=suite.instrument_id, 
           side=0, 
           size=1, 
           limit_price=21050.0
       )
       
       # Clean up when done
       await suite.disconnect()
   
   # Run the async function
   asyncio.run(main())
