# Lighting Paperwork
Pretty lighting paperwork generation from Vectorworks to PDF or Excel!

Using a Vectorworks Data Exchange XML file or a Vectorworks lighting export, this program will generate a channel hookup, instrument schedule, color cut list, and gobo pull list. 
This can either be exported as a PDF, HTML file, or Excel spreadsheet, all of which are neatly formatted for your viewing and printing convenience. 

# Installation

# Usage

## Customization
Much of what this program does is fairly opinionated to my own use case and my sense of what looks nice on paperwork. 
That said, there are some customization options available through the `paperwork.yaml` configuration file. 

If you want to customize the paperwork in a way that hasn't been exposed yet, please file a bug report and we'll see what can be done. 

# Disclaimer
This is a tool that I developed for myself, for my shows, which means I can only confirm that it has worked for this somewhat limited dataset.
As such, please **don't** rely on this as your primary paperwork generation method, and be sure to verify its outputs against your plot.
I use it, I'm happy with it, but I'm not a professional lighting designer and I haven't run into every situation possible -- this program could get confused with new numbering schemes, break on the latest version of Vectorworks, or just not like the instruments that you're using. 
If you need something reliable, trusted, and industry-standard, go buy a copy of [Lightwright](https://www.lightwright.com/) instead.
