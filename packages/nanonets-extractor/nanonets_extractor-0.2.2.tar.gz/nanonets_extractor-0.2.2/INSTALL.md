## Prerequisites

# Test basic functionality
extractor = DocumentExtractor()
print("âœ… Installation successful!")
print("Processing info:", extractor.get_processing_info())
```

## Usage

```python
from nanonets_extractor import DocumentExtractor

# Initialize extractor (no API key needed!)
extractor = DocumentExtractor()

# Extract data from any document
result = extractor.extract("document.pdf")
print(result)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
