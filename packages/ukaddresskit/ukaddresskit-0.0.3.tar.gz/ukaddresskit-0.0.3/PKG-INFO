# ukaddress-ner

UK address NER using CRFsuite with postcode utilities, a model manager, and a CLI.

## Install

```bash
pip install ukaddresskit
```

## Quick Start

Python

```python
from ukaddresskit import parse, tag


print(parse("10 Downing Street SW1A 2AA"))
print(tag("Flat 2, 10 Queen Street, Bury BL8 1JG"))
```

CLI

```cli
ukaddresskit parse "10 Downing Street SW1A 2AA"         # auto-resolves model
ukaddresskit tag   "Flat 2, 10 Queen Street, Bury BL8 1JG"
ukaddresskit postcode "SW1A1AA" --town --county
```

## Postcode Helpers

```python
from ukaddresskit import normalize_postcode, get_post_town, get_county

normalize_postcode("sw1a2aa")  # "SW1A 2AA"
get_post_town("SW1A 2AA")      # "LONDON"
get_county("SW1A 2AA")         # "Greater London" (if in mapping)
```

## Todo

- [ ] Add outcode_to_county.csv into lookups
- [ ] Fix bugs in library not loading on Colab
- [ ] Create [online docs](https://medium.com/practical-coding/documenting-your-python-library-from-zero-to-website-488f87ae58f5)
