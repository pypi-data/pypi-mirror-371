[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/benjaminrall/connect-four-ai).

## Installation and Usage

To play the demo, you first need to install it using `pip`:

```shell

```

Then, you can use the `connect-four` command to load the game. This command
comes with two command-line arguments:

| Option         | Short Flag | Description                                                                                 | Default Value |
|:---------------|:-----------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|:--------------|
| `--difficulty` | `-d`       | The difficulty of the AI player. Must be one of:<br/>'easy', 'medium', 'hard', 'impossible' | impossible    |
| `--player`     | `-p`       | Which player to control (1 = red, 2 = yellow)                                               | 1             |
