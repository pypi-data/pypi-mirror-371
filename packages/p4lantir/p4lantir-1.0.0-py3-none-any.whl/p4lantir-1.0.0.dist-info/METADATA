***

**p4lantir** is a simple tool to perform Man-in-the-Middle over TCP using ARP spoofing, allowing to intercept, drop, forward and see TCP flows.

This project is intended to be relatively simple, making simple future contributions for new features/bug fix.

## Installation
- Install the system dependencies (arpspoof, iptables)
- Create python virtual environnement
- Install the package

Setup instructions :
- [Debian-based (Debian, Kali, Ubuntu,...)](#debian-based-systems)
- [Archlinux](#archlinux)

### Debian-based systems
```bash
sudo apt install dsniff iptables

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install p4lantir
```

### Archlinux
```bash
pacman -S dsniff iptables

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip install p4lantir
```

## Usage
> [!WARNING]
> You need to run the script as root due to arpspoof and iptables. You should open a shell as root, activate the venv and then use *p4lantir*.
```
usage: p4lantir [-h] --host-1 HOST_1 --host-2 HOST_2 [--gateway GATEWAY] -i INTERFACE -l LPORT [--pport PPORT] [--debug]

Man-in-the-Middle over TCP terminal app.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --host-1 HOST_1       First host to spoof, must be the host instanciating the connection
  --host-2 HOST_2       Second host to spoof
  --gateway GATEWAY     Gateway IP
  -i, --interface INTERFACE
                        Interface to perform arp spoofing
  -l, --lport LPORT     Port to listen for MITM attack
  --pport PPORT         Internal port used for proxy.
  --debug               Enable debug mode.
```

### Examples
#### Client/server in the same localhost

Let say that a client at IP *C* connect to a remote server at IP *R*, both in the same LAN. You need to know the name of the interface that connects you this LAN (let call this *iface*. Then your command should look like :
```bash
p4lantir --host-1 [replace with C] \
         --host-2 [replace with R] \
         -i [replace with iface] \
         -lport [server's listening port]
```

> About the listening port, if you intend to intercept SMTP you may choose `25`, `80` for HTTP, and so on ...

### Client/server on a different LAN

If the client is in the same LAN as you and the server is not in your LAN, then you have to add another parameter : the gateway IP. *p4lantir* will then spoof the gateway IP and open a connection to the server.
```bash
p4lantir --host-1 [replace with C] \
         --host-2 [replace with R] \
         --gateway [replace with gw's IP]
         -i [replace with iface] \
         -lport [server's listening port]
```
