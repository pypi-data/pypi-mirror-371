# kilight-client v0.4.2
Python client library for communicating with KiLight devices.

## What is this?
KiLight is a family of open hardware RGB/CCT light controllers. This package probably is not useful to you unless you've built a KiLight device yourself. 

This library is mostly meant for enabling other projects to talk to a KiLight, though it does come with a simple `kilight` command for testing and example purposes.
