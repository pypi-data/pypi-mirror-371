        Evaluate a main sensor formula using Phase 3 execution only.

        This method is used by the main evaluator pipeline after Phases 0-2 have already
        processed the formula (cache checks, variable resolution, dependency management).
        It provides a direct execution path to avoid re-running the full pipeline.

        ARCHITECTURAL REASONING:
        - Main formulas go through the complete pipeline (Phases 0-4) in evaluator.py
        - By the time they reach Phase 3 (execution), all preprocessing is complete
        - Calling the full pipeline again would be redundant and inefficient
        - This method provides a streamlined execution path for pre-processed formulas

        PERFORMANCE BENEFITS:
        - Avoids creating temporary FormulaConfig objects
        - Skips redundant cache checks and variable resolution
        - Eliminates duplicate dependency management processing
        - Reduces memory allocation and processing overhead

        Args:
            resolved_formula: Formula with variables already resolved and substituted
            original_formula: Original formula before variable resolution (for context)
            context: Evaluation context with ReferenceValue objects

        Returns:
            Evaluated result value

        Used by:
            - Main sensor formulas in evaluator.py _execute_with_handler()
            - Alternate state handlers that need direct execution

        Evaluate a formula string via the complete evaluation pipeline (Phases 0-4).

        This method creates a temporary FormulaConfig and runs the full evaluation pipeline
        including cache checks, variable resolution, dependency management, execution,
        and result consolidation. Used for formulas that need complete processing.

        ARCHITECTURAL REASONING:
        - Computed variables and attributes enter the evaluation system as formula strings
        - They need the same processing as main formulas but don't go through the main pipeline
        - Creating a temporary FormulaConfig ensures they get identical processing
        - This maintains consistency across all formula types while allowing different entry points

        WHY NOT USE evaluate_formula:
        - These formulas haven't been processed through Phases 0-2 yet
        - Variable resolution, cache checks, and dependency management are still needed
        - The formula needs to be converted to a FormulaConfig for proper processing
        - Full pipeline ensures consistent error handling and state management

        NOTE ON TERMINOLOGY:
        - "Raw" vs "processed" is misleading - all formulas start as strings
        - The difference is WHEN processing occurs, not WHAT gets processed
        - Main formulas: processed by evaluator.py pipeline, then executed here
        - Other formulas: processed entirely within this method's pipeline

        CACHING AND REUSE MECHANISM:
        - This method is used for the FIRST evaluation of an attribute/variable
        - Once evaluated, the result is cached in the evaluation context
        - Subsequent references to the same attribute/variable use the cached value
        - Cached values bypass the full pipeline - they're treated as "processed"
        - This prevents redundant evaluations and ensures consistency

        PERFORMANCE TRADE-OFFS:
        - Higher overhead due to full pipeline execution
        - Temporary object creation for FormulaConfig
        - Necessary for formulas that need complete processing
        - Acceptable cost for maintaining architectural consistency

        Args:
            formula: Formula string that needs full pipeline processing
            context: Evaluation context with ReferenceValue objects
            variables: Optional variables to include in temporary config
            bypass_dependency_management: Whether to skip dependency management

        Returns:
            Complete EvaluationResult dictionary with success/error states

        Used by:
            - Computed variables that need full variable resolution and processing
            - Attribute formulas that require complete pipeline execution
            - Any formula that needs the same processing as main formulas but enters
              the pipeline at a different point
