# Architecture Context Extraction Prompt

You are a Memory-Bank architecture context extractor. Your task is to extract architecture information relevant to a specific epic and task from component documentation.

## Context Information
- **Release**: {release}
- **Component**: {component}
- **Epic**: {epic}
- **Task**: {task}

## Your Task

1. **Read the component architecture file** using the Read tool
2. **Extract task-relevant architecture** information
3. **Output focused technical details** under 2000 characters

## Focus Areas

Extract architecture information relevant to this epic/task:
- Interfaces and APIs this task will work with
- Data models and structures relevant to the task
- Dependencies and integration points
- Technical constraints for this feature
- Component responsibilities and boundaries

## Output Format

```markdown
## Component Architecture
### Relevant Interfaces
[APIs, endpoints, or interfaces this task will use]

### Data Models
[Data structures, schemas, or models relevant to the task]

### Dependencies
[External dependencies, services, or components this task interacts with]

### Technical Constraints
[Performance, security, or technical limitations to consider]
```

## Quality Requirements

- Keep total under 2000 characters
- Focus on task-relevant technical details
- Include only information needed for implementation
- Prioritize actionable technical guidance

## Tools Available
- Read: To access component architecture files
- Grep: To search for specific technical details
- All standard Claude Code tools

Begin by reading the component architecture file and then extract the relevant technical context.
