# Agent Development Flow Rules

## Core Development Philosophy

### üéØ Iterative Epic-Based Development

**CRITICAL RULE**: Work strictly by epics, then by tasks within each epic. No jumping between epics or skipping tasks.

#### Epic Progression Rules
1. **Complete Epic Before Next**: Epic must be 100% functional before moving to next
2. **All Tasks Required**: Every task in epic must pass acceptance criteria
3. **Integration Testing**: Each epic must integrate with previous epics successfully
4. **No Partial Completion**: Half-working features are worse than no features

#### Task Progression Rules
1. **Sequential Execution**: Tasks within epic executed in dependency order
2. **Atomic Completion**: Each task fully completed before next task
3. **Test-Driven Validation**: All acceptance criteria met before task considered done
4. **Documentation Updated**: Code changes require corresponding documentation updates

### üîç Quality Gates

#### Before Starting Any Task
- [ ] Previous task acceptance criteria fully met
- [ ] All tests passing for current epic components  
- [ ] No blocking issues from previous work
- [ ] Clear understanding of task requirements

#### Before Completing Any Task
- [ ] All acceptance criteria verified
- [ ] Test commands executed successfully
- [ ] Code follows project standards
- [ ] Documentation updated (if applicable)
- [ ] Integration with existing components tested

#### Before Moving to Next Epic
- [ ] All epic tasks completed
- [ ] Epic-level integration tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified
- [ ] Epic fully functional end-to-end

### üö´ Forbidden Actions

#### Code Quality Violations
- **NO BULLSHIT CODE**: No placeholder, dummy, or "temporary" implementations
- **NO OVER-ENGINEERING**: No features beyond defined requirements
- **NO COPY-PASTE**: Every line must serve the specific purpose
- **NO MAGIC NUMBERS**: All constants clearly defined and documented
- **NO SILENT FAILURES**: All errors must be handled explicitly

#### Development Process Violations
- **NO EPIC JUMPING**: Cannot work on Epic 3 while Epic 2 incomplete
- **NO TASK SKIPPING**: Cannot skip "boring" tasks for "interesting" ones
- **NO PARTIAL COMMITS**: Cannot commit half-working functionality
- **NO ASSUMPTION TESTING**: Cannot assume tests pass without running them

#### Architecture Violations
- **NO TIGHT COUPLING**: Components must be independently testable
- **NO GLOBAL STATE**: Avoid global variables and singleton patterns
- **NO PLATFORM ASSUMPTIONS**: Code must work on Linux AND macOS
- **NO DEPENDENCY BLOAT**: Only essential dependencies allowed

### ‚úÖ Required Development Standards

#### Code Quality Requirements
```python
# GOOD: Clear, simple, testable
def create_question(self, agent_id: str, question: str) -> str:
    """Create HIL question and return message ID."""
    message_id = self._generate_message_id()
    # Implementation...
    return message_id

# BAD: Complex, unclear, untestable
def do_stuff(self, *args, **kwargs):
    # Some magic happens here...
    return "something"
```

#### Architecture Requirements
- **Single Responsibility**: Each class/function has one clear purpose
- **Dependency Injection**: Dependencies passed explicitly, not hidden
- **Interface Segregation**: Small, focused interfaces
- **Clear Boundaries**: Distinct separation between systems

#### Testing Requirements
- **Critical Tests Only**: Test essential functionality, not implementation details
- **Fast Execution**: Tests run quickly for rapid feedback
- **Clear Assertions**: Test failures clearly indicate what broke
- **Platform Coverage**: Tests verify cross-platform compatibility

### üìù Development Journal Rules

#### Context Tracking in current-context.md
Every development session must update the context file with:

1. **Current Epic/Task**: What specifically is being worked on
2. **Key Decisions**: Architecture choices and reasoning
3. **Discovered Issues**: Problems found and how they were solved
4. **Integration Points**: How current work connects to other components
5. **Next Steps**: What needs to happen next

#### Required Journal Entries
- **Before Starting Work**: Current state and goals
- **After Each Task**: Results, issues, learnings
- **After Each Epic**: Integration status and handoff notes
- **When Blocked**: Detailed problem description and attempted solutions

### üåê Communication Standards

#### Code and Documentation Language
- **All Code**: English comments, variable names, function names
- **All Documentation**: English (README, docstrings, error messages)
- **All Commit Messages**: English with clear, descriptive messages
- **All API Interfaces**: English naming and documentation

#### Communication with Human
- **All Conversations**: Russian language
- **Status Reports**: Russian with technical details
- **Problem Discussions**: Russian for better understanding
- **Decision Clarifications**: Russian for nuanced explanations

### üîß Technical Implementation Rules

#### Error Handling Standards
```python
# REQUIRED: Explicit error handling with clear messages
try:
    result = api_call()
except APIError as e:
    logger.error(f"API call failed: {e}")
    raise UserFriendlyError(
        f"Unable to connect to transcription service. "
        f"Please check your internet connection and API key."
    ) from e

# FORBIDDEN: Silent failures or generic errors
try:
    result = api_call()
except:
    pass  # BAD: Silent failure
```

#### Configuration Management
- **Environment Variables**: Support for all config overrides
- **Validation**: All config values validated at startup
- **Defaults**: Sensible defaults for all optional settings
- **Documentation**: All config options clearly documented

#### Cross-Platform Compatibility
```python
# REQUIRED: Platform-aware implementation
def get_config_dir() -> Path:
    if platform.system() == 'Darwin':
        return Path.home() / 'Library' / 'Application Support' / 'claude-helpers'
    else:  # Linux
        return Path.home() / '.config' / 'claude-helpers'

# FORBIDDEN: Platform assumptions
config_dir = Path.home() / '.config' / 'claude-helpers'  # BAD: Linux only
```

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Enforcement

#### Component Boundaries
1. **Audio System**: Independent, no dependencies on other features
2. **Configuration System**: Foundation for all other systems
3. **Dialog System**: Independent UI abstraction
4. **HIL System**: Orchestrates other components
5. **CLI Interface**: Thin layer over core functionality

#### Integration Rules
- **Loose Coupling**: Components communicate through well-defined interfaces
- **Dependency Direction**: Higher-level components depend on lower-level ones
- **No Circular Dependencies**: Clear hierarchy of dependencies
- **Testable Interfaces**: All integration points have test doubles

### üìä Progress Validation

#### Task Completion Criteria
Each task must demonstrate:
1. **Functional Requirement**: Feature works as specified
2. **Quality Requirement**: Code meets quality standards  
3. **Test Requirement**: All test commands pass
4. **Documentation Requirement**: Usage is documented
5. **Integration Requirement**: Works with existing components

#### Epic Completion Criteria
Each epic must demonstrate:
1. **End-to-End Functionality**: Complete user workflows work
2. **Performance Requirements**: Meets all benchmarks
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful failure in all error scenarios
4. **Cross-Platform**: Verified working on Linux and macOS
5. **User Experience**: Intuitive and helpful for end users

### üöÄ Release Readiness

#### Production Standards
- **Zero Critical Bugs**: No known issues that break core functionality
- **Complete Documentation**: All features documented with examples
- **Performance Verified**: All benchmarks met on target platforms
- **Security Reviewed**: No known vulnerabilities
- **User Tested**: Manual testing completed successfully

#### Maintenance Considerations
- **Clear Code Structure**: Easy for future developers to understand
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Debugging information available when needed
- **Upgrade Path**: Configuration and data migration considered
- **Backward Compatibility**: Changes don't break existing usage
