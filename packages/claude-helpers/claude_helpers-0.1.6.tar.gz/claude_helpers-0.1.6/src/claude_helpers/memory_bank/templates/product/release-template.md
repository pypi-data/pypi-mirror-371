# [Release Name] Requirements Document

## Introduction
<!-- 
Provide a brief overview of what this release aims to achieve:
- What are we building?
- Why are we building it?
- What value does it provide?
- Who will use it?

Keep it to 2-3 paragraphs maximum.
-->

## Alignment with Product Vision
<!--
Explain how this release supports the overall product vision:
- Which aspects of the vision does it advance?
- How does it fit into the bigger picture?
- What foundation does it lay for future releases?

Reference specific points from product/vision.md
-->

## Requirements

### Requirement [Number]: [Short Name]
<!--
For each major requirement, create a section following this pattern.
Requirements should be specific, measurable, and testable.
-->

**User Story:** As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]

<!--
Role examples:
- For technical releases: engineer, developer, system
- For user-facing releases: user, admin, customer
- Be specific about the actor
-->

#### Acceptance Criteria
<!--
Use formal language with SHALL/SHOULD/MAY:
- SHALL = mandatory requirement
- SHOULD = highly recommended
- MAY = optional

Format patterns:
- WHEN [event] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
- IF [precondition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
- WHEN [event] AND [condition] THEN [system] SHALL [response]
- [System] SHALL [capability]

Be specific and measurable. Each criterion should be verifiable.
-->

1. WHEN [specific event occurs] THEN system SHALL [specific response]
2. IF [precondition exists] THEN system SHALL [behavior]
3. System SHALL [capability with measurable parameters]

### Requirement [Number]: [Short Name]

**User Story:** As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. [Acceptance criterion]
2. [Acceptance criterion]
3. [Acceptance criterion]

## Risks & Mitigations

### Risk: [Risk Name]
<!--
For each significant risk:
-->
**Description:** [What could go wrong]
**Impact:** [High/Medium/Low]
**Mitigation:** [How to prevent or handle]

## Deliverables

## Notes for PRD Authors

1. **Be Specific:** Avoid vague requirements. Each requirement should be testable.

2. **User Stories:** Even for technical releases, frame requirements as user stories to clarify the "why".

3. **Acceptance Criteria:** These are your contract with engineering. Make them clear and measurable.

4. **Scope:** Be explicit about what's NOT included to prevent scope creep.

5. **Keep it Concise:** PRDs should be thorough but not verbose. Aim for clarity.

6. **Version Control:** PRDs may evolve. Track changes and maintain version history.

7. **Validation:** Create a corresponding validation.md file to track success metrics separately.
