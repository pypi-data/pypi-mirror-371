# Component QA: ModusID

## Component Validation
- [ ] All epics completed and tested
- [ ] Auth endpoints working correctly
- [ ] JWT tokens valid with proper claims
- [ ] Role-based access control enforced
- [ ] Error handling for edge cases

## Integration Points
- ModusID → Cognito: User management and authentication works
- ModusID → Platform API: JWT validation succeeds with public key
- Admin UI → ModusID: Role assignment endpoints respond correctly

## Test Scenarios
1. Full auth flow: Register → Login → Refresh → Access protected resource → Logout
2. Role assignment: Super admin changes user role, user gets elevated permissions
3. Invalid requests: Wrong credentials return 401, expired tokens rejected
4. System recovery: Service restart doesn't lose active sessions

## Sign-off Criteria
- [ ] All epics validated
- [ ] Performance meets requirements (< 200ms auth operations)
- [ ] Security requirements satisfied (RS256, token rotation)
- [ ] Ready for production deployment
