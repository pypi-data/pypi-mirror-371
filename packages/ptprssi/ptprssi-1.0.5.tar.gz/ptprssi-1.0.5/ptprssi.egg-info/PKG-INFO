## PTPRSSI - Path-Relative Style Sheet Import Testing Tool

ptprssi is a tool that tests domains for path relative style sheet import vulnerabilities. <br />
This tool utilizes threading for fast parallel domain testing.

## Installation
```
pip install ptprssi
```

## Adding to PATH
If you're unable to invoke the script from your terminal, it's likely because it's not included in your PATH. You can resolve this issue by executing the following commands, depending on the shell you're using:

For Bash Users
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

For ZSH Users
```bash
echo "export PATH=\"`python3 -m site --user-base`/bin:\$PATH\"" >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

```
ptprssi -u https://www.example.com/
ptprssi -l domainList.txt
```
