The **Simplex Python SDK** is a library designed to facilitate structural engineering computations, including foundation design, soil modeling, load analysis, and more. It provides a robust API for interacting with engineering data, performing calculations, and generating results in compliance with Eurocode standards.

## Installation

```bash
pip install simplexpy
```

Prefer a UI? The Simplex web apps are backed by the same API and can be easier for quick checks, exploratory design, visualization, or when you don't need full scripting.
