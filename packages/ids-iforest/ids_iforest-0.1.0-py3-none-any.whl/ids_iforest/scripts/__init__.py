"""Scripts for dataset generation and preparation.

The ``ids_iforest.scripts`` package contains auxiliary command‑line
programs that are not part of the core IDS functionality but help
create training datasets.  At the moment it includes only
``generate_datasets``, which can synthesise flows for benign and
attack traffic.  Future extensions may add CIC‑IDS parsing and other
dataset utilities.
