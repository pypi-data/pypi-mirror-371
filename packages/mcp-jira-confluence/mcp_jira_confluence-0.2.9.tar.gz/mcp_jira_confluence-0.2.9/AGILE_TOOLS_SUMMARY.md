- Historical data analysis from similar resolved issues
- Story point patterns specific to your project
- Confidence levels and alternative estimates
- Reference to most similar resolved issues
- Perfect for sprint planning and effort estimation

## Technical Implementation

### Backend (JiraClient methods)

- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides reliability metrics for recommendations

## Usage Examples

### For Scrum Masters
1. Start with `get-agile-boards` to see all boards
2. Use `get-board-sprints` to check active sprints
3. Run `get-daily-standup-summary` for comprehensive team status
4. Identify blockers and team workload distribution

### For Sprint Planning
1. Use `estimate-story-points` for effort estimation
2. Apply `get-task-assignment-recommendations` for optimal work distribution
3. Review historical patterns and team expertise
4. Make data-driven planning decisions

### For Team Management
1. Monitor sprint progress with daily standup summaries
2. Balance workload using assignment recommendations
3. Track team performance patterns
4. Identify potential process improvements

## Benefits
