# MCP Jira & Confluence v0.2.10 - Complete Summary

## 🎯 **Mission Accomplished**

Successfully fixed all reported issues with the agile/scrum tooling and published version 0.2.10 to PyPI.

## 🐛 **Issues Fixed**

### 1. Daily Standup Summary NoneType Error (v0.2.8)
- **Problem**: `get_daily_standup_summary` failing with "NoneType object has no attribute 'get'"
- **Root Cause**: Missing null checks when accessing nested Jira API response objects
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive null checking for status, assignee, priority, and other nested objects

### 2. Story Points Estimation Project Key Error (v0.2.9)
- **Problem**: `estimate_story_points` failing with "the value '' does not exist for the field 'project'"
- **Root Cause**: Empty project key being passed to JQL queries
- **Solution**: Added project key validation and enhanced story points field detection

### 3. Task Assignment Recommendations Similar Issues (v0.2.9)
- **Problem**: Same project key error affecting assignment recommendations
- **Solution**: Applied same validation and null checking fixes

### 4. Project Key Missing from Issue Data (v0.2.10)
- **Problem**: `get_issue()` method not fetching project field, causing "project key not found" errors
- **Root Cause**: Field list in `get_issue()` and `search_issues()` missing `project` and `components` fields
- **Solution**: 
  - Added `project` and `components` to field lists in API calls
  - Added fallback logic to extract project key from issue key format (e.g., "PROJ-123" -> "PROJ")
  - Enhanced error messages with better context

### 5. Version Control Hygiene
- **Problem**: `__pycache__` files were being tracked in git
- **Solution**: Removed from version control and ensured proper .gitignore handling

## 🔧 **Technical Improvements**

### Enhanced Error Handling
- Added comprehensive null safety throughout all agile methods
- Improved error logging with detailed stack traces
- Added fallback behavior for API failures
- Better validation of API response structures

### Story Points Field Detection
- Extended detection to multiple common field names:
  - `customfield_10016` (most common)
  - `customfield_10004`, `customfield_10002`, `customfield_10011`, `customfield_10008`
  - `storypoints`, `Story Points`

### JQL Query Improvements
- Enhanced query building with proper validation
- Better component and issue type filtering
- Improved error handling for search failures
