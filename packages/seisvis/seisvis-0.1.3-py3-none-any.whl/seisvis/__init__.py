Purpose:
    Developed for academic research in seismic data visualization,
    including 1D well log plotting, 2D section visualization, and 3D volumetric rendering
    of geophysical properties.

Acknowledgments:
    This project leverages open-source resources and some colormaps from:
        - Matplotlib (https://matplotlib.org/)
        - OpendtectColormaps (https://github.com/whimian/OpendtectColormaps)
    
    We gratefully acknowledge the contributors of these libraries for their valuable tools
    and visual assets, which enhance the clarity and quality of seismic interpretation.
