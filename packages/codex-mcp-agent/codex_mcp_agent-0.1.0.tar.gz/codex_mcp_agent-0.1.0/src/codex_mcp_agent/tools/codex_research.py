Context:

Goal:
Investigate the following topic within this repository and produce a concise, actionable analysis:
"{topic}"

Process Guidelines:
1) Map the project layout (key packages, entrypoints, tools, configs).
2) Identify modules, functions, or data relevant to the topic.
3) Read only the necessary files; quote key snippets with file paths and line ranges.
4) Note behaviors, assumptions, and risks; highlight missing pieces or unknowns.
5) Propose next steps (experiments, code changes, tests, or metrics) with commands.

Deliverable (use this structure):
- Summary: 3â€“6 bullet points.
- Key Areas: modules/files and their roles (with paths).
- Findings: evidence-backed observations with inline quotes.
- Risks & Gaps: potential issues and open questions.
- Next Steps: prioritized actions with concrete commands.
