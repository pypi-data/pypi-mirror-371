# WB-WriteupBuilder

**WriteupBuilder** is a command-line tool for creating clean, organized CTF write-ups in Markdown — interactively or using a ready-to-fill advanced template.

Whether you want to quickly document your hacking process or prepare a professional post-CTF report, `wb` guides you through each section and saves your work in a well-structured `.md` file.

## 🚀 Usage

### **1️⃣ Interactive Mode**

Fill in each section via guided prompts.

```bash
wb
```

You’ll be asked for:

- Challenge overview (name, platform, category, etc.)
    
- Initial info
    
- Initial analysis
    
- Exploitation steps
    
- Flags
    
- Takeaways
    

The result is saved as:

```
<challenge_name>-<platform>.md
```

---

### **2️⃣ Advanced Template Mode**

Generate a **pre-written detailed Markdown template** for manual filling.

```bash
wb -t -fn MyWriteup.md
```

**Options:**

|Flag|Description|
|---|---|
|`-fn`, `--filename`|Output file name (default: `WriteupTemplate.md`)|
|`-t`, `--template`|Use the advanced pre-written template|

---

## 🧪 Example Run

Below are **two** example sessions: one for the interactive flow and one for the template flow. This shows the prompts and sample user input.

### 1) Interactive session

**Notes**

* Filenames are sanitized to lowercase and spaces/special characters are replaced with underscores.

* For multi-line answers the tool expects you to type `END` on a new line to finish. Pressing Enter immediately at the first prompt of a multiline field skips that section.
