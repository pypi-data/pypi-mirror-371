    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In many engineering applications, such as the response analysis of marine structures exposed to waves, use of the wave spectrum is required in order to carry on the computations. In those cases, the sea state parameters can be exploited to reconstruct the wave spectrum by applying an adequately chosen **parameterised spectrum**. \n",
    "\n",
    "There exist several standard forms of wave spectra. The choice of one form is application-specific and made based on the geographical area of study. Among other effects, the water depth, the predominance of wind sea over swell, or the opposite, and the fetch – defined as the length of the body of water that the wind blows over – should be considered (Mounet, 2023).\n",

    "- Significant wave height: $H_s =$ 2 m.\n",
    "- Peak wave period: $T_p =$ 10 s."
