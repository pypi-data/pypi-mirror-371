What is NetSSE?
---------------

**NetSSE** is an open-source Python package for network-based sea state estimation from ships, buoys, and other observation platforms. The objective of NetSSE is to provide a scientific framework to develop, test, and distribute new sea state estimation methods. All code is available at the `NetSSE GitLab <https://gitlab.gbar.dtu.dk/regmo/NetSSE>`_.


.. note::

   This project is under active development and will be running until December 2027.
