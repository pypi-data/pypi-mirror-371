COMMUNITY VERSION
-----------------

| Welcome to the RF Surveillance Node one of four inter-related application suite 
| RF Node is about scanning existing range of radio frequency and sending the data to the RF Central. RF Node works in a plug and play which means unlimited 
 devices can be connected such as RTL-SDR or other  radio frequency device reader 
 | High quality SDR devices (RTL-SDR, USRP, BladeRF, HackRF etc..) can be attached to read QAM data at a much higher pre-configured rate. Sample size can be changed also
   from a setting file
