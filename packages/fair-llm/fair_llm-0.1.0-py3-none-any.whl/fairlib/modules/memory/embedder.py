"""
This module provides concrete implementations of the AbstractEmbedder interface.

Embedders are responsible for converting text into numerical vectors, which is a
foundational step for semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
This file includes a `DummyEmbedder` for testing and a functional
`SentenceTransformerEmbedder` for production use.
