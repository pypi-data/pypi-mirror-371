"""
CAP3D-Viz: High-Performance 3D Visualization for CAP3D Files

A modular Python package for efficient parsing and interactive 3D visualization
of CAP3D files generated by capacitance solvers. Features state-machine parsing,
memory-efficient streaming, and advanced Level-of-Detail rendering for large datasets.

Key Features:
- State-machine parser with 70-80% reduced condition checking
- Memory-efficient streaming for files with 10k+ blocks  
- Interactive 3D visualization with batched rendering
- Professional IC design features and industry-standard colors
- Comprehensive CAP3D format support (blocks, polys, layers, windows, tasks)
