central_carbon_metabolites.csv

This folder contains example compound lists used by the master package.

Files:
- central_carbon_metabolites.csv: a best-effort list of central carbon metabolism related
  compounds (glycolysis, TCA cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, amino acids, organic acids,
  nucleotides, fatty acids, cofactors). The CSV was generated by `ccm.py` which:
  - Uses a curated name list included in the script.
  - Resolves structural identifiers (MolecularFormula, CanonicalSMILES, InChIKey) via PubChem PUG-REST
    with retries and basic normalization.
  - Writes a CSV with columns: Name, Formula, SMILES, InChIKey.

Notes:
- This is a programmatically generated list. For authoritative lists, use database bulk downloads
  (HMDB, KEGG, ChEBI) and provide explicit IDs. Prefer HMDB or ChEBI for metabolomics work.
- Some compound names may be ambiguous; verify entries before use.
