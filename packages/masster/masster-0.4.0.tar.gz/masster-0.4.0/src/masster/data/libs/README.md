metabolite lib CSVs

This folder contains programmatically generated metabolite lists used as example libs for the master package.

Files (generated by scripts in the repository root):
- `urine_metabolites.csv` - best-effort list of metabolites reported in human urine (generated by `urine.py`).
- `central_carbon_metabolites.csv` - curated central carbon metabolism compound list (generated by `ccm.py`).

Generation method:
- Names were curated in the scripts and resolved to structural identifiers via PubChem PUG-REST.
- `urine.py` attempts to parse local HMDB XML (if present) before falling back to the HMDB web listing.
- Both scripts use retries and basic normalization to improve PubChem matching.

Notes & recommendations:
- For authoritative resource lists, download HMDB / ChEBI / KEGG bulk data and map IDs (preferred).
- Respect HMDB licensing and attribution when using HMDB data.
- Verify ambiguous or missing entries before use in production analyses.
