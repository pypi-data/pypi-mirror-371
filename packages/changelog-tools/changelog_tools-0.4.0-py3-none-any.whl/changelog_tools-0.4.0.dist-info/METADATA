## CLI

### Usage

```shell
python3 -m changelog_tools <command> [options]
python3 -m changelog_tools --help  # Display usage information and a list of the provided commands.
```

### Available commands

#### **get**

Check and display the latest version of a changelog file, which is by default the CHANGELOG.md file in the current directory.

```shell
python3 -m changelog_tools get
```

**<CHANGELOG_PATH>** (optional)

Specifies a changelog path. If given path is a directory, the tool defaults a CHANGELOG.md file in that directory.

```shell
python3 -m changelog_tools get data/CHANGELOG.md
```

#### **summarize**

To get a list of changes between two versions, run the script:

```shell
python3 -m changelog_tools summarize --old <old_version> --new <new_version> <changelog_path>
```

**--old** (optional)
Specifies a version from which to start looking for changes. This version corresponds to the lowest/oldest of the file.
If not provided, the tool defaults to the initial version. If provided version does not exist in the file, it'll raise an error.

**--new** (optional)
Specifies a version to end looking for changes. This version corresponds to the highest/latest version of the file.
If not provided, the tool defaults to the latest version. If provided version does not exist in the file, it'll raise an error.

**--include_unreleased** (optional)
Set by default to False. It is used to include unreleased items to the output, if needed.

**<CHANGELOG_PATH>** (optional)

Specifies a changelog path. If given path is a directory, the tool defaults a CHANGELOG.md file in that directory.

##### Example of what you'll get

Summary with different sections sorted by alphabetical order.

## As a lib

### Usage

1. Get the package from PyPI and add it to your virtual environment

```shell
python3 -m venv venv
pip install changelog-tools
```

2. In your python file, import the package as following:

```python
import changelog_tools
```

### Most common use cases

* Get the **latest version** of a changelog file

```python
latest_version = changelog_tools.get_latest_version(<CHANGELOG_PATH>)
```

* Get a **summary** of all entries of a changelog file

```python
summaries = changelog_tools.get_summary(<CHANGELOG_PATH>)

# Display dict with changes sections sorted by alphabetic order
for summary in sorted(summaries.keys()):
    print(f"\n{summary}\n")
    for change in summaries[summary]:
        print(change)
```
