AusPIX_DGGS

This is the base python DGGS engine for the AusPIX developmental DGGS by Geoscience Australia.

These modules were sourced from:

https://github.com/ANU-Linked-Earth-Data/dggs/tree/master/rhealpix_dggs

•	Module code was then slightly changed to ensure calls to modules match the actual module names.

•	Other slight changes were made to fix minor bugs.

See other folder for wrappers that call these modules to perform specific tasks.

This code may still contain bugs.
