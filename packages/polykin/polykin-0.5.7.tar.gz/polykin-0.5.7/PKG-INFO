## Tutorials

The main features of PolyKin are explained and illustrated through a series of [tutorials](https://hugomvale.github.io/polykin/tutorials/) based on Jupyter [notebooks](https://github.com/HugoMVale/polykin/tree/main/docs/tutorials),
which can be launched online via Binder.

## Installation

PolyKin currently runs on Python>=3.10. You can install it from PyPI via `pip` (or `uv`):

```console
pip install polykin
# uv add polykin
```

Alternatively, you may install it directly from the source code repository:

```console
pip install git+https://github.com/HugoMVale/polykin.git
# uv add git+https://github.com/HugoMVale/polykin.git
```
