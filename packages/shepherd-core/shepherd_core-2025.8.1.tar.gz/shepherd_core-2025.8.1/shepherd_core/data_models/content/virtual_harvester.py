class VirtualHarvesterConfig(ContentModel, title="Config for the Harvester"):
    """The virtual harvester configuration characterizes usage of an energy environment.

    It is used to both harvesting during emulation and to record
    energy environments (sometimes referred to as "harvesting traces").

    For emulation:

    The virtual harvester configuration describes how energy from a recorded
    energy environment is harvested. Typically, the energy environment provides
    an IV-surface, which is a continuous function in three dimensions: voltage,
    current, and time. Based on this surface, the emulation can derive the
    available IV-curve at each point in time. The harvester looks up the current
    that is available (according to the energy environment) from a given
    harvesting voltage. The harvesting voltage may be dynamically chosen by the
    harvester based on the implemented harvesting algorithm, which models
    different real-world harvesters. For example, a maximum power point tracking
    harvester may choose a harvesting voltage as a ratio of the open circuit
    voltage available from the energy environment (or transducer in practice).

    The energy environments are encoded not as a three-dimensional function, but
    as IV tuples over time (sampled at a constant frequency). This originates
    from the technical implementation when recording the IV-surface, where the
    recorder provides the IV-curve by measuring the current for a given voltage
    and ramping the voltage from minimal to maximum.

    For harvest-recordings:

    An energy environment is fully described by the IV surface, which are IV
    curves over time. Shepherd approximates this by sampling the current at
    equidistant steps of a voltage ramp. The VirtualHarvesterConfig is also used
    to parameterize the recording process, typically, it should be configured to
    record a full IV surface, as this contains the full information of the energy
    environment. The postponed harvesting is then performed during emulation.

    However, it is also possible to record a "pre-harvested" energy environment
    by performing the harvesting during recording. This results in a recording
    containing IV samples over time that represent the harvesting voltage
    (chosen by the virtual harvester during recording) and the current available
    from the energy environment for that voltage. Together, these represent the
    power available for harvesting at the time, and during emulation, this power
    can be converted by the input stage (boost converter) to charge the energy
    storage.
