## Description

The Lyzr Agent API is a modular, universal agent framework designed to simplify the creation of LLM-based agents. This Python client library aims to provide a seamless Python interface to interact with the API, abstracting away the HTTP request details and providing dedicated client objects for each major API section.

The framework's architecture is divided into three main components:

*   **Environment:** Defines the modules, features, available tools, and other configurations for your agent.
*   **Agent:** Specifies your agent's configuration, including the system prompt, name, and persona. The agent operates within an environment identified by an environment ID.
*   **Inference:** Handles the processing and execution of tasks and conversations.

This client library provides specific client classes for different API versions and functionalities, organized for clarity and ease of use.

## Installation

You can install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install lyzr-python-sdk
```

### Quick Start
Here's a basic example demonstrating how to initialize the client and make a simple API call:

```python
from lyzr_python_sdk import LyzrAgentAPI
import os

# Replace with your actual API key.
# It's recommended to use environment variables for sensitive information.
api_key = os.environ.get("LYZR_AGENT_API_KEY")
if not api_key:
    raise ValueError("LYZR_AGENT_API_KEY environment variable not set.")

try:
    # Initialize the main client
    client = LyzrAgentAPI(api_key=api_key)

    # Access a specific API section (e.g., Agents)
    print("Fetching agents...")
    agents = client.agents.get_agents_by_api_key()
    print("All Agents:", agents)

except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
```
