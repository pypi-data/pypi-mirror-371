# Automatic Apostrophe Handling Solution

## Problem Solved
LLMs frequently fail with apostrophe-containing queries like "John's Documents" due to Google Drive API escaping requirements.

## Solution
**Automatic apostrophe escaping** implemented in all search tools - no manual escaping required.

## Implementation
Added automatic `.replace("'", "\\'")` to all search queries and folder names in:

✅ **`drive_search_files`** - Main file search  
✅ **`drive_find_folder_by_name`** - Folder search with optional file search  
✅ **`drive_search_files_in_folder`** - Search within specific folder  

## Before vs After

### Before (Error-prone)
```python
# LLM had to manually escape apostrophes
"John\'s Documents"  # Often forgotten, causing failures
```

### After (Automatic)
```python  
# LLM uses natural language
"John's Documents"  # Automatically converted to "John\'s Documents"
```

## Benefits
1. **Robust** - No more apostrophe-related failures
2. **User-friendly** - Natural language queries work immediately  
3. **Reliable** - Eliminates retry loops from escaping mistakes
4. **Concise** - Simple `.replace()` handles all cases

## Test Cases Now Working
- "John's Documents" ✅
- "Today's Reports" ✅
- "Children's Folder" ✅

The tools now handle apostrophes transparently - LLMs can use natural language without escaping concerns.
