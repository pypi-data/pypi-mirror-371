# NOMAD CAMELS driver for a demo digital multimeter

Simulated demo digital multimeter for testing, written for the measurement software [NOMAD CAMELS](https://fau-lap.github.io/NOMAD-CAMELS/).


## Features
This driver can be used to get familiar with the functionalities of NOMAD CAMELS without using an actual instrument / setup.

It is usually used together with the [demo source measure unit](https://pypi.org/project/nomad-camels-driver-demo-source-measure-unit/), where more options are available.

Both these drivers can communicate with each other. The typical usage for the demo digital multimeter is to read out a resistance from this demo (a Pt1000) which may then be converted to a temperature.
