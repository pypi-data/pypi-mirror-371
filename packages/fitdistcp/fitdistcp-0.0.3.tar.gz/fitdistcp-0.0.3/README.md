# fitdistcp

fitdistcp is a free Python package for fitting statistical models using calibrating priors, with the goal of making reliable predictions. Install using >pip install fitdistcp.

fitdistcp implements the method developed in *Reducing Reliability Bias in Assessments of Extreme Weather Risk using Calibrating Priors*, S. Jewson, T. Sweeting and L. Jewson (2024): https://doi.org/10.5194/ascmo-11-1-2025.

More information and examples are available at https://www.fitdistcp.info, including the equivalent (more comprehensive) R package.

Development of this package was funded by the Lighthill Risk Network: https://lighthillrisknetwork.org.


### Example: Fitting a GEV distribution
```python
import numpy as np
import scipy.stats
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import fitdistcp.genextreme

x = scipy.stats.genextreme.rvs(0, size=20)                  # make some example training data 
p = np.arange(0.001,0.999,0.001)                            # define the probabilities at which we wish to calculate the quantiles
q = fitdistcp.genextreme.ppf(x,p)                           # this command calculates two sets of predictive quantiles for the GEV, 
                                                            # one based on maxlik, and one that includes parameter uncertainty based on a calibrating prior
print(q['ml_params'])                                       # have a look at the maxlik parameters
plt.plot(q['ml_quantiles'],p, label='ML')                   # plot the maxlik quantiles
plt.plot(q['cp_quantiles'],p,color='red', label='CP')       # plot the quantiles that include parameter uncertainty
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```


### Models
The following models are currently supported. Let us know if you have any suggestions for other models to include.
- expon: Exponential distribution
- gamma: Gamma distribution
- genextreme: Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution
- genextreme_p1 & genextreme_p12: Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) distribution, with 1 predictor, 2 predictors
- genpareto: Generalised Pareto distribution
- gumbel: Gumbel distribution
- lnorm: Lognormal distribution
- norm:	Normal distribution
- weibull:	Weibull distribution


### Methods
Four methods are provided for each model: ppf(x) (quantiles, 'percentage point function'), rvs(n, x) (random variates), pdf(x) and cdf(x), where x is the data to fit.
To use, e.g. ppf for the exponential distribution, import fitdistcp.expon and call fitdistcp.expon.ppf(x).
