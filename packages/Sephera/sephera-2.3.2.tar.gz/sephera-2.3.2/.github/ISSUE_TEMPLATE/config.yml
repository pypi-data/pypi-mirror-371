        # Issue Template - Sephera CLI

        ## Description of the Issue or Feature Request
        ---
        * Clearly describe the bug or the new feature you are requesting.
        * Example: "The `sephera loc` command does not correctly detect `.ts` extensions."

        ---
        * **Please briefly describe what you expected to happen, like:**

        | Sephera Version | Operating System | Current Shell | Python Version |
        |-----------------|------------------|---------------|----------------|
        | e.g: v1.0.0     | e.g: ArchLinux   | e.g: zsh      | e.g: 3.13      |

        - **Note:** Current Shell and Python Version are optional.
        Python version is mainly useful if you are building Sephera from source.
