Return the signal and the reasoning (3 bullet points) behind it. Look at the emperical values passed to you to determine the result based on the following logic:

Note that for Stoch RSI, both %K and %D values must be fulfilling the threshold requirement.

## Labeling Logic:
- **Sell Signal**: If price is **more than 3% above the trend** and **Stoch RSI > 80**.
- **Possible Buy Entry**: If **price is above trend**, **AO is positive**, and **Stoch RSI â‰¤ 25**.
- **Bullish**: If **price is above trend**, **AO is positive**, and **25 < Stoch RSI < 75**.
- **Bearish**: If **price is below trend** AND **AO is negative**.
- **Inconclusive**: If **only one** of trend or AO is bearish (not both).
