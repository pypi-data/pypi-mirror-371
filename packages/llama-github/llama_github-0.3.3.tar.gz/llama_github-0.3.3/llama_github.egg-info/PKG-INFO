It empowers LLM Chatbots, AI Agents, and Auto-dev Agents to solve complex coding tasks. Whether you're a developer looking for quick solutions or an engineer implementing advanced Auto Dev AI Agents, llama-github makes it easy and efficient.

If you like this project or believe it has potential, please give it a ‚≠êÔ∏è. Your support is our greatest motivation!

## Architecture
![High Level Architecture](./docs/high_level_architecture.drawio.svg)

## Installation
```
pip install llama-github
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use llama-github:

```python
from llama_github import GithubRAG

# Initialize GithubRAG with your credentials
github_rag = GithubRAG(
    github_access_token="your_github_access_token", 
    openai_api_key="your_openai_api_key", # Optional in Simple Mode
    jina_api_key="your_jina_api_key" # Optional - unless you want high concurrency production deployment (s.jina.ai API will be used in llama-github)
)

# Retrieve context for a coding question (simple_mode is default set to False)
query = "How to create a NumPy array in Python?"
context = github_rag.retrieve_context(
    query, # In professional mode, one query will take nearly 1 min to generate final contexts. You could set log level to INFO to monitor the retrieval progress
    # simple_mode = True
)

print(context)
```

For more advanced usage and examples, please refer to the [documentation](docs/usage.md).
