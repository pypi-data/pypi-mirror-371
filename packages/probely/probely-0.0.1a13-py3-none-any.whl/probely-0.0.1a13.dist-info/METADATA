# Probely

## Installation

Probely CLI requires Python 3.8 or higher.  
Install the package using pip:  

```sh
pip install probely==0.0.1a13
```

This project is currently in its alpha stage and undergoing rapid development.  
As a result, significant changes that could impact existing implementations may occur without notice.  
To maintain stability, **we strongly recommend pinning the project version you are using.**

## Overview

Probely is a vulnerability scanner for APIs and web applications, designed to empower security teams and software developers in scanning and securing their web applications and APIs. 

This package provides a Command-Line Interface (CLI) to interact with the Probely API, allowing you to perform actions like scanning targets, listing findings, and managing targets directly from your terminal.

**For detailed documentation and usage examples, please visit our [CLI documentation](https://developers.probely.com/cli/overview-cli-documentation).**
