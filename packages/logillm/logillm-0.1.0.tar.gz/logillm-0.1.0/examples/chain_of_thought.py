"""Chain of Thought Reasoning with LogiLLM.

This example demonstrates how LogiLLM handles complex reasoning tasks:
1. Basic prediction vs. chain of thought
2. Step-by-step mathematical reasoning
3. Complex analysis with intermediate steps
4. Debugging reasoning with trace outputs

Chain of thought prompting helps language models break down complex problems
into smaller, manageable steps, leading to more accurate results.

Prerequisites:
- OpenAI API key: export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
- Install LogiLLM with OpenAI support: pip install logillm[openai]
