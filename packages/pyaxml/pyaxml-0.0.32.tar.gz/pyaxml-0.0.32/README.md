  PyAxml is a full python tool to play with AXML (Android XML) files.
  This tool is useful to decode and encode AXML files and manipulate AXML files
  over a [Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/) object.
  It is designed to work with Python 3 only.
  Some examples of the use of the tool is provided with the project:
  - copymanifest.py that allow to decode and reencode the original file
  - replace_activity_name.py to change the name an activity and replace by an
  other
  
  If you want to see more example you can dig more on the project
  [apkpatcher](https://gitlab.com/MadSquirrels/mobile/apkpatcher) that use this
  library to add some useful permission and inject a library inside the target
  application.
