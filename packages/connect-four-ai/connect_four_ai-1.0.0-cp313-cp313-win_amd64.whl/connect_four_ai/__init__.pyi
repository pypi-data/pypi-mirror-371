"""
A high performance implementation of a perfect Connect Four solver, written in Rust.

This library provides functionality to compute the score and optimal move for any
given Connect Four position.
"""

class Position:
    """Represents a Connect Four position compactly as a bitboard.

    The standard, 6x7 Connect Four board can be represented unambiguously
    using 49 bits in the following bit order:

       6 13 20 27 34 41 48
       5 12 19 26 33 40 47
       4 11 18 25 32 39 46
       3 10 17 24 31 38 45
       2  9 16 23 30 37 44
       1  8 15 22 29 36 43
       0  7 14 21 28 35 42

    The extra row of bits at the top identifies full columns and prevents
    bits from overflowing into the next column. For computational
    efficiency, positions are stored using two 64-bit unsigned integers:
    one storing a mask of all occupied tiles, and the other storing a mask
    of the current player's tiles.
