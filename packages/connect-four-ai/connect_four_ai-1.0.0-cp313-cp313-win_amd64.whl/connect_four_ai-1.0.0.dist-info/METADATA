This library can strongly solve any Connect Four position and determine the optimal move.
For full details, performance benchmarks, and demos, please see the main
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/benjaminrall/connect-four-ai).

## Key Features

- **Perfect Solver**: Implements an optimised negamax search,
  which utilises alpha-beta pruning and a transposition table
  to quickly converge on exact game outcomes.

- **AI Player**: Features an AI player with configurable difficulty. It can play
  perfectly by always choosing the optimal move, or can simulate a range of
  skill levels by probabilistically selecting moves based on their scores.

- **Bitboard Representation**: Uses a compact and efficient bitboard representation for
  game positions, allowing for fast move generation and evaluation.

- **Embedded Opening Book**: Includes a pre-generated opening book of depth 8, which is
  embedded directly into the binary for instant lookups of early-game solutions.

- **Parallel Book Generator**: A tool built with `rayon` for generating new, deeper
  opening books.

- **Cross-Platform**: Available as a Rust crate, Python package, and WebAssembly module for
  seamless integration into a wide range of projects.

## Installation

To use the library, you can simply install it using `pip`:

```shell
pip install connect-four-ai
```

### Example Usage

This is a basic example of how to use the `Solver` to find the score of a position:

```python
from connect_four_ai import Solver, Position

# Creates a position from a sequence of 1-indexed moves
position = Position.from_moves("76461241141")

# Initialises and uses the Solver to calculate the exact score of the position
solver = Solver()
score = solver.solve(position)

print(score)    # Output: -1
```
