# lufah

Little Utility for FAH v8

A python command line utility for macOS, Linux, Windows

## Requirements

- python 3.9 or later

## Install from PyPI

Install in isolated user environment (preferred):
```
pip install pipx
pipx install lufah
```

Or
```
pip install lufah
```

## Uninstall

```
pip install pipx
pipx uninstall lufah
```

Or
```
pip uninstall lufah
```

## Install from source

macOS / Linux / Windows
```

cd lufah
make install-user
```

## Uninstall from source

```
git clone https://github.com/kbernhagen/lufah.git
cd lufah

## Usage

Note that lufah uses unencrypted, direct websocket connections.
This is what Web Control uses to connect to the local client.
This has security implications if you enable direct remote access on a client.
See [HOWTO: Allow v8 Client Remote Control](https://foldingforum.org/viewtopic.php?t=39050)

lufah -a /mygpu1 config cpus 0
lufah -a host1,host2,host3 units
lufah -a host1,host2,host3 info
```

## Notes

If not given, the default command is "units".

If there are multiple groups, config requires a group name,
except for account settings (user, team, passkey, cause).

For command `lufah -a /groupname config cpus N`, N is not limited to unused cpus across groups.

Group "/" is taken to mean the default group, which is "".

For a group name actually starting with "/", use prefix "//".
Example: `lufah -a somehost//rg1 finish`

An error may not be shown if connection times out.

Commands start and stop are macOS-only.

The `top` command is glitchy on Windows when the window is resized.
Type space to force a redraw.
To use `lufah top` on Windows, you may need to manually install `windows-curses`.

## Example Output

```
lufah -a .,panda.local units
```
```
