    TODO:
    - Extend match to Many-Versus-Many match
    - Extend match to Free-for-all
    - LEVEL_MIXTURES: define differents ways to mix levels in a teams, sum/avg/median/ and set a parameters to tune it solvers
    - Create const value for standard score (maybe enum types) i.e Score.win := [1,0]| Score.lose := [0,1]/ Score.draw := [0.5, 0.5]
    - Work on Score type
    - Add predict() to solvers (and to the stypes.Solver Protocol ?)
