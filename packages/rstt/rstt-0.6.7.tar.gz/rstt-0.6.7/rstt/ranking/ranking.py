"""Ranking Module

This module implements utility decorator and a general ranking class.

    1. Container Equivalence (Union = Intersection):
    
        - (key in self.datamodel.ratings) <=> (key in self.standing).
        - In the code we refer to 'equivalence'

    2. Rank Disambiguity (point '=' rating):
    
        - self.datamodel.ordinal(key) == self.standing.value(key) for all keys.
        - In the code we refer to 'disambiguity'
