    TODO: BYE-round
        a way to make the number of partcipant more flexible in practice is to introduce bye-round.
        Certain players who can not face an opponent are given a 'free' win. 
        A simple approach to implement it is to create BYE player(s), always losing, and remove them of the final state of the event.
        To ensure the lose of BYE players, the competition.solver can be wrapped in one that hanle BYE-games and delegate for others.
