I am nominating myself for the position of the OpenStack Technical Committee
(TC) Chair for 2024.2. As a first time TC member, the strengths I can bring to
this role are my fresh perspective, ideas, and dedication towards this
community's ideals.

I firmly believe in consensus building, and hugely value the
diversity of thought and opinion that have shaped OpenStack for the past ~15
years. So, as a chair, I will strive to have all voices be heard, and foster
discussions without pride or prejudice.

We thrive through many changes in the technology we seek to define in a huge
part due to stable governance. I wish to uphold this while I execute `the
duties <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/tc-chair-responsibilities.html>`_
required of the TC chair.

Thank you for your consideration!
