Dear TC colleagues,

I'd like to nominate myself for the role of OpenStack TC Chair.
Over the past year, I've had the privilege of serving as the TC
Chair, focusing on fostering consensus, improving communication,
and ensuring that all voices in our group and the community are
heard. I've directed our collective, limited resources towards
reducing arcane and esoteric processes, while preserving ones
that strengthen us as an effective guiding body of a sustainable
and successful community.

If elected, through weekly  updates, active engagement in meetings
and PTGs, and shepherding of resolutions and governance, I will
continue making the TC more transparent and welcoming.

Thank you for your consideration!
