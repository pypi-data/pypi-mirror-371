Hi all,

Please consider my candidacy for the role of chair of the OpenStack Technical
Committee.

I believe that the primary role of the TC chair is to facilitate,
encourage, and promote discussions and a welcoming environment for these
discussions to take place in. It is also that of a bridge, between the
community and the TC, between the TC and the board, and between
individual TC members.

In achieving those goals, the biggest toolset at their disposal is that of
time, streamlining the processes and minutae and making sure discussions
have a place and enough time, making the best use of these limited
resources to progress towards a decision/solution.

I want to create an environment that is not dominated by a few voices.

In pursuit of these goals, Iâ€™m ready to ask the stupid questions, hear the
crazy ideas, and attempt to create bridges where there aren't, or reinforce
them where there are. In particular with the board, community and other
open source projects.

If I am elected, not all of my attempts are going to succeed, and I'm okay
with accepting where I've failed, but please bear with me as I learn the ropes
and give me a chance to grow into these big shoes.

Thank you for you consideration,
Kristi Nikolla
