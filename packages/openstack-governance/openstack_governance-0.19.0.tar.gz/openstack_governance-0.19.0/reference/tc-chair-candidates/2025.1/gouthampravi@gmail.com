Dear TC colleagues,

I'm expressing my interest in continuing as Chair through
the 2025.1 release cycle. During the past cycle, I leaned
heavily on past chairs (JayF, gmann) and colleagues with
tenure on the TC to understand the responsibilities of the
role. I learned a lot and enjoyed exercising my spirit of
consensus-building with mutual respect. As my teammates,
you were always willing to correct me and support my efforts
to improve collaboration among ourselves and with the
community we serve.

I wish to continue in this role to solidify some of the
processes we've found effective. I also intend to spearhead
projects that are important to the community but less
glamorous to pursue, such as addressing goals that are
becoming technical debt. Additionally, I'm excited to
coordinate the Project Teams Gathering, define investment
opportunities, and work with the OpenInfra Foundation Board
through their meetings and community events.

Thank you for your consideration!
