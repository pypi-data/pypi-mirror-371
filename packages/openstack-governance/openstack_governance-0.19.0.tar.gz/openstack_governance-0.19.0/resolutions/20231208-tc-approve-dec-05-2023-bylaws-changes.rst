2023-08-12 TC approve Dec 5th, 2023 bylaws changes
==================================================

There is an update to the OpenInfra Foundation bylaws that cleans up some of
the old special-case text for the OpenStack project. Some of the changes in
bylaws `have been moved to the OpenStack TC charter <https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/governance/+/903236>`__ or to the
`Openinfra Project Confirmation Guidelines <https://board.openinfra.dev/en/ProjectConfirmationGuidelines>`__.

The diff of bylaws changes can be found in :download:`oif_bylaws_openstack_is_oip.pdf </resolutions/20231208-tc-approve-dec-05-2023-bylaws-changes/oif_bylaws_openstack_is_oip.pdf>` which is sent to the
`foundation ML <https://lists.openinfra.dev/archives/list/foundation@lists.openinfra.dev/thread/6FBOOK7WVBRHYOBQPTF2T2CNJOO7XMSQ/>`__

OpenInfra Board has approved the bylaw changes in
`Dec 5th, 2023 board meeting <https://board.openinfra.dev/meetings/2023-12-05>`__

After Board approval, OpenStack TC needs to approve those bylaw changes.

This TC resolution approves the bylaw changes which have been
approved by OpenInfra Board in the Dec 5th, 2023 Board meeting.
