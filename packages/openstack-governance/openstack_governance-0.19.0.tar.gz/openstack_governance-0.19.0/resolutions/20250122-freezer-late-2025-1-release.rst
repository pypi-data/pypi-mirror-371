2025-01-22 Late addition of Freezer to 2025.1 Release
=====================================================

The Technical Committee has identified that the Freezer project can
be considered as active again, as it maintains a healthy CI/CD pipelines
during previous cycle. Freezer Core Reviewers team was established and
reviews as well as communication with the team is efficient enough to
consider a project as ready for production in its current form.
However, the current policy around
`Emerging and inactive projects <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/emerging-technology-and-inactive-projects.html>`__
requires a project to be added to the release if identified as
active before milestone-2.

This TC resolution instructs the releases team to proceed with release
activities for Freezer for the 2025.1 release, given the fact that
Freezer team has proposed their `client release <https://review.opendev.org/c/openstack/releases/+/938780>`_
in time for milestone-2.
