2024-02-27 Remove Murano from 2024.1 Release
============================================

The Technical Committee recently identified that the Murano project is
inactive and has critical bugs which make it unsuitable for use in
production in its current form. However, the current policy around
`Emerging and inactive projects <https://governance.openstack.org/tc/reference/emerging-technology-and-inactive-projects.html>`__
only permits a project to be removed from the release if identified as
inactive before milestone-2.

This TC resolution instructs the releases team to cease release activities
for Murano for the 2024.1 release. It shall remain excluded from OpenStack
releases until CI is fixed, all known security issues are resolved, and
there is maintainer activity consistant with a healthy OpenStack project.
