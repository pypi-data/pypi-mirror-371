    A simple in-memory rate limiter for FastAPI applications.

    This rate limiter limits the number of requests a client can make within a specified time window.

    Attributes:
        times (int): The maximum number of requests allowed per client within the specified period.
        seconds (int): The time window in seconds during which requests are counted.
        requests (Dict[str, List[float]]): A dictionary storing request timestamps for each client IP.
        detail (str): The detail message to be returned to the client if the requests exceed the limit within the specified period.
