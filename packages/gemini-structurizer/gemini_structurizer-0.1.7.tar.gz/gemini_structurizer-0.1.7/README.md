# Gemini Structurizer

**Transform unstructured files into structured JSON using the Google Gemini API.**

Gemini Structurizer is a Python library and command-line tool that leverages the power of Google's Gemini models to parse various file types (e.g., `.txt`, `.pdf`) and extract information into a user-defined JSON schema. It's designed to be flexible and configurable, allowing users to define the extraction logic through prompts and schemas.

## Key Features

*   **AI-Powered Structure Extraction**: Utilizes Gemini's multimodal capabilities to understand file content.
*   **Configurable Processing**: Define extraction logic using a YAML configuration file.
*   **File Upload & Management**: Automatically handles uploading files to the Gemini API and cleaning them up afterward.
*   **Flexible Input**: Process files specified via a configuration file, command-line arguments, or directly within your Python scripts.
*   **Dynamic Prompts**: Supports using placeholders in your prompts and passing variables at runtime for more flexible and reusable tasks.
*   **Automatic Output Naming**: Output JSON files are conveniently named based on the input file.
*   **Skip Existing Files**: By default, avoids reprocessing files if the target JSON output already exists (can be overridden).
*   **Library & CLI**: Can be used both as a Python library in your projects and as a standalone command-line tool.

## ⚠️ Breaking Changes in Version 0.1.5

This version introduces significant updates to improve usability and stay current with the latest Google AI tools. Please review the following changes:

*   **Configuration Format Changed to YAML:** The configuration file format has been switched from JSON (`.json`) to **YAML (`.yaml`)**.
    *   **Reason:** YAML is more human-readable, supports comments, and handles multi-line strings gracefully, making configurations much easier to write and maintain.
    *   **Action Required:** You must convert your existing `.json` config files to the new `.yaml` format. Run `gemini-structurize init` to generate a new template and see the correct structure.

*   **Upgraded to Latest Google GenAI SDK:** The library now depends on **`google-genai>=1.20.0`**, the latest official Python SDK for the Gemini API.
    *   **Benefit:** This modernizes all internal API calls, ensuring better stability, performance, and compatibility with the newest features and models released by Google. While this is an internal change, it is a significant upgrade to the core engine of the tool.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.9+
*   A Google Cloud Project with the Gemini API enabled.
*   A Gemini API key. Set this key to an environment variable named `GOOGLE_API_KEY`.

```bash
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
```

### From PyPI

```bash
pip install gemini-structurizer
```

## Usage

### As a Command-Line Tool

The CLI is a primary way to interact with the tool and operates with two main subcommands: `init` and `run`.

1.  **Initialize (`init`)**

    First, use the `init` command to create a sample configuration file named `config.yaml` in your current directory. This gives you a great starting point for the new format.

    ```bash
    gemini-structurize init
    ```
    You can also specify a different output path: `gemini-structurize init --output my_task.yaml`

2.  **Edit the Configuration File (`config.yaml`)**

    Next, edit the generated YAML file to match your specific task.

    ```yaml
    # Gemini Structurizer Configuration (YAML)
    # ==========================================

    # (Required) Specify the name of the Gemini model to use.
    # Examples: "gemini-1.5-pro-latest", "gemini-1.5-flash-latest"
    model_name: "gemini-1.5-flash-latest"

    # (Optional) System-level instructions for the model, defining its role and behavior.
    system_instruction: "You are an AI assistant specialized in extracting character lines from a script."

    # (Required) Specific instructions for processing the file.
    # You can use placeholders like {placeholder}, which can be filled at runtime.
    # {filename} is a built-in, always-available placeholder.
    user_prompt_for_file_processing: |
      Please carefully read the content of the file '{filename}'.
      My objective is to extract all lines spoken by the character '{character_name}'.
      Please return the result strictly according to the JSON schema provided below.

    # (Required) The definition of the desired output JSON structure.
    # Paste your JSON Schema as a multi-line string directly here.
    output_json_schema: |
      {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
          "character_name": { "type": "string" },
          "dialogues": {
            "type": "array",
            "items": { "type": "string" }
          }
        },
        "required": ["character_name", "dialogues"]
      }
    ```

3.  **Run the Process (`run`)**

    Once your config file is ready, use the `run` command to process your file.

    ```bash
    # -c specifies the config file, -i specifies the input file
    gemini-structurize run -c config.yaml -i path/to/your/input.txt
    ```
    After processing, a `.json` file with the same name as your input file will appear in the same directory.

    *   **To overwrite existing output**:
        ```bash
        gemini-structurize run -c config.yaml -i input.txt --overwrite
        ```

### As a Python Library

You can achieve greater flexibility by using `gemini-structurizer` directly in your Python projects.

#### Example 1: Basic Usage

This is the most straightforward use case, executing a task by providing a config file and an input file.

```python
import gemini_structurizer
import os

# Ensure GOOGLE_API_KEY is set in your environment
# os.environ['GOOGLE_API_KEY'] = "YOUR_API_KEY" # For testing only, not recommended for production

input_doc_path = "path/to/your/document.txt"
config_path = "path/to/your/task_config.yaml"

# Ensure the config file (task_config.yaml) and input file (document.txt) are created as needed.

json_output_path = gemini_structurizer.structure_file_with_gemini(
    input_filepath=input_doc_path,
    config_path=config_path,
    overwrite_existing_output=True
)

if json_output_path:
    print(f"Processing successful! Output is at: {json_output_path}")
    # You can now read and use the file at json_output_path
else:
    print("Processing failed.")
```

#### Example 2: Using Dynamic Variables in the Prompt

This is a very powerful feature. You can define placeholders in your `user_prompt_for_file_processing` within the config file and then pass the actual values at runtime.

Assume your `config.yaml` prompt is: `"...extract all lines for the character '{character_name}'..."`

```python
# ...continuing from above...

# Define a dictionary where the keys match the placeholders in your prompt
prompt_variables = {
    "character_name": "Bob"
}

# Pass the dictionary using the template_variables parameter
json_output_path = gemini_structurizer.structure_file_with_gemini(
    input_filepath="dialogue.txt",
    config_path="dialogue_config.yaml",
    template_variables=prompt_variables, # <--- The magic happens here
    overwrite_existing_output=True
)

if json_output_path:
    print(f"Successfully extracted lines for character: '{prompt_variables['character_name']}'!")
# ...
```

#### Example 3: Multi-Tasking & Direct Config Injection

Instead of relying on a file, you can pass a Python dictionary directly as the configuration. This is very useful for managing multiple tasks.

```python
import yaml # To load multiple task configs from a single large YAML file

# Assume you have a multi_task_config.yaml file defining several tasks
with open("multi_task_config.yaml", 'r', encoding='utf-8') as f:
    all_tasks = yaml.safe_load(f)

# Select the configuration for one of the tasks
user_profile_task_config = all_tasks['tasks']['extract_user_profile']

# Pass the config dictionary directly to the config_data parameter
json_output_path = gemini_structurizer.structure_file_with_gemini(
    input_filepath="user_profile.txt",
    config_data=user_profile_task_config, # <--- Pass the dictionary directly
    overwrite_existing_output=True
)

if json_output_path:
    print("User profile extraction task complete!")
# ...
```

## How It Works

1.  The tool loads a YAML configuration file that defines the Gemini model, system instructions, user prompt (how to process the file), and the desired output JSON schema.
2.  The specified input file is uploaded to the Gemini API.
3.  The Gemini model processes the file content based on your prompts and attempts to generate a JSON output that conforms to your provided schema.
4.  The resulting JSON is saved to a file.
