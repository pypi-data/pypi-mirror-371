## Introduction

\b TOMCA (Tissue Optics Monte Carlo Analysis) is a TNO package written for Monte Carlo analysis of light through tissues and scattering media based on the MCX package.  TOMCA helps organize shared functions between projects and aims to make research, simulation, and analysis easier.

Monte Carlo eXtreme (MCX) is a fast physically-accurate photon simulation software for 3D heterogeneous complex media. By taking advantage of the massively parallel threads and extremely low memory latency in a modern graphics processing unit (GPU), this program is able to perform Monte Carlo (MC) simulations at a blazing speed, typically hundreds to a thousand times faster than a single-threaded CPU-based MC implementation.

  - [MCX parameters list](https://mcx.space/wiki/index.cgi?Options)

The algorithm of this software is detailed in the References \cite Yan2020 , \cite Fang_2009 , \cite Yu2018.

## Using JSON-formatted input files

Our model files and jcfg dict in code are based on the mcx JSON structure used in the .exe version of the scripts.  This was chosen so that our code is always backwards compatible with the NEU group.  See their documentation for the exact specifications on inputs (link)

to see a suite of examples showing the key functionalities of MCXLAB (using GNU Octave).


## Using PMCX in Python

We have based our code on the python binding of MCX called PMCX. 

Please read the `pmcx/README.txt` file for more details on how to install and 
use PMCX.
