# Projekat kurs_dolara

## Primary goal of this project

Learn and setup python publish workflow on pypi


## Program features

Program koji prikazuje trenutni kurs dolara prema podacima sa web sajta Centralne banke BiH
Current rate is published on page https://cbbh.ba/CurrencyExchange/

I have checked reading that url with curl and have got this result:

```
curl -s https://cbbh.ba/CurrencyExchange/ | grep 840 -A2 -B2
                    </td>
                    <td class="tbl-smaller tbl-center">1</td>
                    <td class="tbl-smaller tbl-center">840</td>
                            <td class="tbl-smaller tbl-center buysell-column" style="display:none;">1.670039</td>
                            <td class="tbl-smaller tbl-highlight tbl-center middle-column">1.674225</td>
```


According to the result, todays USD course (code 840) is 1.670039 KM.

So the program should say:

Dana≈°nji kurs USD je 1.670039 KM.
