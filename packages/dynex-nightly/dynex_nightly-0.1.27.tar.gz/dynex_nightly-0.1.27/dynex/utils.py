    Samples a Qubo problem.

    :Parameters:

    - :Q: The Qubo problem

    - :offset: The offset value of the Qubo problem

    - :logging: Defines if the sampling process should be quiet with no terminal output (FALSE) or if process updates are to be shown (`bool`)

    - :mainnet: Defines if the mainnet (Dynex platform sampling) or the testnet (local sampling) is being used for sampling (`bool`)

    - :description: Defines the description for the sampling, which is shown in Dynex job dashboards as well as in the market place  (`string`)

    - :num_reads: Defines the number of parallel samples to be performed (`int` value in the range of [32, MAX_NUM_READS] as defined in your license)

    - :annealing_time: Defines the number of integration steps for the sampling. Models are being converted into neuromorphic circuits, which are then simulated with ODE integration by the participating workers (`int` value in the range of [1, MAX_ANNEALING_TIME] as defined in your license)

    - :clones: Defines the number of clones being used for sampling. Default value is 1 which means that no clones are being sampled. Especially when all requested num_reads will fit on one worker, it is desired to also retrieve the optimum ground states found from more than just one worker. The number of clones runs the sampler for n clones in parallel and aggregates the samples. This ensures a broader spectrum of retrieved samples. Please note, it the number of clones is set higher than the number of available threads on your local machine, then the number of clones processed in parallel is being processed in batches. Clone sampling is only available when sampling on the mainnet. (`integer` value in the range of [1,128])

    - :switchfraction: Defines the percentage of variables which are replaced by random values during warm start samplings (`double` in the range of [0.0, 1.0])

    - :alpha: The ODE integration of the QUBU/Ising or SAT model based neuromorphic circuits is using automatic tuning of these parameters for the ODE integration. Setting values defines the upper bound for the automated parameter tuning (`double` value in the range of [0.00000001, 100.0] for alpha and beta, and [0.0 and 1.0] for gamma, delta and epsilon)

    - :beta: The ODE integration of the QUBU/Ising or SAT model based neuromorphic circuits is using automatic tuning of these parameters for the ODE integration. Setting values defines the upper bound for the automated parameter tuning (`double` value in the range of [0.00000001, 100.0] for alpha and beta, and [0.0 and 1.0] for gamma, delta and epsilon)

    - :gamma: The ODE integration of the QUBU/Ising or SAT model based neuromorphic circuits is using automatic tuning of these parameters for the ODE integration. Setting values defines the upper bound for the automated parameter tuning (`double` value in the range of [0.00000001, 100.0] for alpha and beta, and [0.0 and 1.0] for gamma, delta and epsilon)

    - :delta: The ODE integration of the QUBU/Ising or SAT model based neuromorphic circuits is using automatic tuning of these parameters for the ODE integration. Setting values defines the upper bound for the automated parameter tuning (`double` value in the range of [0.00000001, 100.0] for alpha and beta, and [0.0 and 1.0] for gamma, delta and epsilon)

    - :epsilon: The ODE integration of the QUBU/Ising or SAT model based neuromorphic circuits is using automatic tuning of these parameters for the ODE integration. Setting values defines the upper bound for the automated parameter tuning (`double` value in the range of [0.00000001, 100.0] for alpha and beta, and [0.0 and 1.0] for gamma, delta and epsilon)

    - :zeta: The ODE integration of the QUBU/Ising or SAT model based neuromorphic circuits is using automatic tuning of these parameters for the ODE integration. Setting values defines the upper bound for the automated parameter tuning (`double` value in the range of [0.00000001, 100.0] for alpha and beta, and [0.0 and 1.0] for gamma, delta and epsilon)

    - :minimum_stepsize: The ODE integration of the QUBU/Ising or SAT model based neuromorphic circuits is performig adaptive stepsizes for each ODE integration forward Euler step. This value defines the smallest step size for a single adaptive integration step (`double` value in the range of [0.0000000000000001, 1.0])

    - :debugging: Only applicable for test-net sampling. Defines if the sampling process should be quiet with no terminal output (FALSE) or if process updates are to be shown (TRUE) (`bool`)

    - :bnb: Use alternative branch-and-bound sampling when in mainnet=False (`bool`)

    - :block_fee: Computing jobs on the Dynex platform are being prioritised by the block fee which is being offered for computation. If this parameter is not specified, the current average block fee on the platform is being charged. To set an individual block fee for the sampling, specify this parameter, which is the amount of DNX in nanoDNX (1 DNX = 1,000,000,000 nanoDNX)

    - :shots: Sets the minimum number of solutions to retrieve from the network. Works both on mainnet=False and mainnet=True (Default: 1). Typically used for situations where not only the best global optimum (sampleset.first) is required, but multiple optima from different workers.

    :Returns:

    - Returns a dimod sampleset object class:`dimod.sampleset`
