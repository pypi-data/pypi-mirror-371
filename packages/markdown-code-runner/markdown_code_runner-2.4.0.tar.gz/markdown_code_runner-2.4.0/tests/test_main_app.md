# Test Markdown File

This is a test Markdown file for the `markdown_code_runner` project.

## Code Block 1

Here's a simple code block:

<!-- CODE:START -->
<!-- print('Hello, world!') -->
<!-- CODE:END -->
<!-- OUTPUT:START -->
<!-- ⚠️ This content is auto-generated by `markdown-code-runner`. -->
Hello, world!

<!-- OUTPUT:END -->

## Code Block 2

Here's another code block:

<!-- CODE:START -->
<!-- print('This is another code block!') -->
<!-- CODE:END -->
<!-- OUTPUT:START -->
<!-- ⚠️ This content is auto-generated by `markdown-code-runner`. -->
This is another code block!

<!-- OUTPUT:END -->

## Code Block 3

Here's a code block using backticks:
Where the `markdown-code-runner` is removed if `backtick_standardize` is enabled and a separate output file is specified.

```python markdown-code-runner
x = 10
y = 20
print(f'The sum of {x} and {y} is {x + y}')
```
<!-- OUTPUT:START -->
<!-- ⚠️ This content is auto-generated by `markdown-code-runner`. -->
The sum of 10 and 20 is 30

<!-- OUTPUT:END -->

That's it for this test file!
