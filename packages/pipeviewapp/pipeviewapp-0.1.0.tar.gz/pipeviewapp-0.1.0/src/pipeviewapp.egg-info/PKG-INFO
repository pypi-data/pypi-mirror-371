# PipeViewApp

[![license][license-img]][github] [![Donate][kofi-img]][kofi]

An interactive TUI (Terminal User Interface) for piped data.

`PipeViewApp` allows you to instantly browse, filter, and inspect JSON, CSV, and plain text data directly from your command line, turning static output into a fully interactive experience.


## Features

-   **Interactive TUI:** No more chaining `grep`, `awk`, and `jq`. Explore your data in a user-friendly interface.
-   **Real-time Filtering:** Instantly filter thousands of rows just by typing.
-   **Auto-Format Detection:** Intelligently parses JSON, CSV, and line-delimited JSON (LDJSON) without any configuration.
-   **Cross-Platform:** Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows.
-   **Lightweight & Fast:** Starts instantly and handles large amounts of data smoothly.

## Installation

The recommended way to install `PipeViewApp` is from PyPI using pip.

```bash
pip install pipeviewapp
```


## How to Use
PipeViewApp uses a simple, two-step workflow to ensure maximum compatibility and interactivity across all terminal environments.


### Step 1: Capture Data with pipeview-cache
Pipe any command's output into the pipeview-cache command. This captures the data and saves it to a temporary cache file.
### Examples:
```bash
## On Linux/macOS
# JSON
curl -s "https'://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos" | pipeview-cache

# csv
cat data.csv | pipeview-cache

# plain-text 
cat data.log | pipeview-cache



## On Windows PowerShell
# JSON
(Invoke-WebRequest "https'://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos").Content | pipeview-cache

# csv
Get-Content .\data.csv | pipeview-cache

# plain-text
Get-Content .\data.log | pipeview-cache
```
### Step 2: View Data with pipeview
Now, simply run the pipeview command to launch the interactive UI. It will automatically load the data you just captured.
```bash
pipeview
```
The interactive TUI will launch, allowing you to:
Filter: Start typing to filter the data in real-time.
Navigate: Use the Up/Down arrow keys.
Inspect: Press Enter on a row to see a detailed view.
Quit: Press q or Ctrl+C to exit.


## For Developers: Building from Source
If you want to contribute to the project or build it from the source code, follow these steps.

### 1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the project from GitHub:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/manti-X/pipeviewapp.git
cd pipeviewapp
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
It is highly recommended to work within a Python virtual environment.
```bash
# Create the environment
python3 -m venv .venv
```
### 3. Activate it
```bash
# On Linux/macOS:
source .venv/bin/activate
```
```bash
# On Windows:
.\.venv\Scripts\activate
```

### 4. Install in Editable Mode
Install the package and its dependencies in "editable" mode. This allows you to make changes to the source code and see them reflected immediately without reinstalling.
```bash
pip install -e .
```
You can now run the pipeview and pipeview-cache commands as if they were installed normally.
