Lunch Money Python Client

This Module Leverages Class Inheritance to distribute API Methods Across a series of
clients. Ultimately, everything inherits from the
lunchable.models.core.LunchMoneyAPIClient class which facilitates interacting with
the API.

For example: to see source code on interactions with the "transactions" API endpoint you
will refer to the TransactionsClient object.
