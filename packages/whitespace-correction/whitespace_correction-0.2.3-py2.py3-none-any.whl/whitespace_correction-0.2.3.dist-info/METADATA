              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Whitespace correction using Transformers

Correct missing or spurious whitespaces in text. See the corresponding [Paper at ACL 2023](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-demo.37/).

### Installation

This project is mainly tested with Python 3.10, but should work fine with Python 3.8 and newer versions.

#### From PyPI

Windows (x64) and  Linux are currently supported when installing from PyPI.

```bash
pip install whitespace-correction
```

#### From source

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ad-freiburg/whitespace-correction.git
cd whitespace-correction
pip install .

```

### Usage

#### From python

```python
from whitespace_correction import WhitespaceCorrector

# list all available models
print(WhitespaceCorrector.available_models())

# create a whitespace corrector instance, using the default pretrained model
cor = WhitespaceCorrector.from_pretrained()
# you can move the whitespace correction model to a different device, e.g.
cor.to("cuda")  # default
cor.to("cuda:3")  # if you have multiple GPUs (alternatively use cor.to(3))
cor.to("cpu")
# you can also set the inference precision (default is the 
# precision used for training), e.g.
cor.set_precision("fp32")
cor.set_precision("fp16")
cor.set_precision("bfp16")

# correct single strings
corrected_string = cor.correct_text("p l e se,repiar thissen ten se!")

# correct multiple strings at once
repaired_strings = cor.correct_text([
    "p l e se,repiar thissen ten se!",
    "alsosplitthissentenceforme"
])

# correct text file (every line is treated as a separate sequence to correct),
# returns an iterator over corrected lines
corrected_lines = cor.correct_file("path/to/file.txt")
# optionally specify an output file,
# returns None
corrected_lines = cor.correct_file("path/to/file.txt", output_file="save/output/here.txt")
```

#### From command line

After installation the command `wsc` (short for **w**hite**s**pace **c**orrection) is available in your python environment. 
It lets you use the whitespace correction models directly from the command line.
Below are examples of how to use `wsc`. See `wsc -h` for all options.

```bash
# print version
wsc -v

# list available models
wsc -l

# by default wsc tries to read stdin, corrects the input it got line by line 
# and prints the corrected lines back out
# therefore, you can for example use whitespace correction with pipes
echo "splitthissentenceforme" | wsc
cat "path/to/input/file.txt" | wsc > output.txt

# correct a string using
wsc -p "splitthissentenceforme"

# correct a text file line by line and print the corrected lines
wsc -f path/to/input/file.txt
# optionally specify an output file path where the corrected lines are saved
wsc -f path/to/input/file.txt -o output.txt

# start an interactive whitespace correction session
# where your input will be corrected and printed back out
wsc -i

# start a whitespace correction server with the following endpoints:
### /models [GET] --> output: available models as json 
### /info [GET] --> output: info about backend as json
### /evaluate [POST] input: input, output, and groundtruth text --> output: evaluation metrics as json
### /correct [POST] input: some text to correct --> output: corrected text and runtime information as json
wsc --server <config_file>

### OPTIONS
### Pass the following flags to the wsc command to customize its behaviour
-m <model_name> # use a different whitespace correction model than the default one 
--cpu # force execution on CPU, by default a GPU is used if available
--progress # display a progress bar (always on when a file is repaired using -f)
-b <batch_size> # specify a different batch size
-batch-max-tokens <batch_max_tokens> # limit batch by a number of tokens and not by number of samples
-u # do not sort the inputs before correcting
--precision # set inference precision (one of fp32, fp16 and bfp16)
-e <experiment_dir> # specify the path to an experiment directory to load the model from 
                    # (equivalent to WhitespaceCorrector.from_experiment(experiment_dir) in python API)
--force-download # force download of the whitespace correction model even if it was already downloaded
--progress # show a progress bar while correcting
--report # print a report on the runtime of the model after finishing the correction
```

> Note: When first using `wsc` with a pretrained model, the model needs to be downloaded, so depending on
> your internet speed the command might take considerably longer.

> Note: Loading the whitespace correction model requires an initial startup time each time you
> invoke the `wsc` command. CPU startup time is around 1s, GPU startup time around 3.5s, so for small
> inputs or files you should probably pass the `--cpu` flag to force CPU execution for best performance.

> See [configs/server.yaml](configs/server.yaml) for an exemplary server configuration file.

### Documentation

#### Use pretrained model

If you just want to use this project to correct whitespaces, this is the recommended way.

```python
from whitespace_correction import WhitespaceCorrector

cor = WhitespaceCorrector.from_pretrained(
    # pretrained model to load, get all available models from available_models(),
    # if None, loads the default model
    model=None,
    # the device to run the model on
    # ("cuda" by default)
    device="cuda",
    # optional path to a cache directory where downloaded models will be extracted to,
    # if None, we check the env variable WHITESPACE_CORRECTION_CACHE_DIR, if it is not set 
    # we use a default cache directory at <install_path>/api/.cache 
    # (None by default)
    cache_dir=None,
    # optional path to a download directory where pretrained models will be downloaded to,
    # if None, we check the env variable WHITESPACE_CORRECTION_DOWNLOAD_DIR, if it is not set 
    # we use a default download directory at <install_path>/api/.download
    # (None by default)
    download_dir=None,
    # force download of model even if it already exists in download dir
    # (False by default)
    force_download=False
)
```

When used for the first time with the command line interface or Python API the pretrained model will be automatically downloaded. 
However, you can also download our pretrained models first as zip files, put them in a directory on your local drive 
and set `WHITESPACE_CORRECTION_DOWNLOAD_DIR` (or the `download_dir` parameter above) to this directory.

#### Use own model

Once you trained your own model you can use it in the following way.

```python
from whitespace_correction import WhitespaceCorrector

cor = WhitespaceCorrector.from_experiment(
    # path to the experiment directory that is created by your training run
    experiment_dir="path/to/experiment_dir",
    # the device to run the model on
    # ("cuda" by default)
    device="cuda"
)
```

### Directory structure

The most important directories you might want to look at are:

```
configs -> (example yaml config files for training and server)
src -> (library code used by this project)
```

### Docker

You can also run this project using docker. Build the image using

`docker build -t whitespace-correction .`

If you have an older GPU build the image using

`docker build -t whitespace-correction -f Dockerfile.old .`

By default, the entrypoint is set to the `wsc` command, 
so you can use the Docker setup like described [here](#from-command-line) earlier.

You can mount /wsc/cache and /wsc/download to volumes on your machine, such that
you do not need to download the models every time.

```bash
# correct text
docker run whitespace-correction -c "correctthisplease"

# correct file
docker run whitespace-correction -f path/to/file.txt

# start a server
docker run whitespace-correction --server path/to/config.yaml

# with volumes
docker run -v $(pwd)/.cache:/wsc/cache -v $(pwd)/.download:/wsc/download \
  whitespace-correction -c "correctthisplease"

# optional parameters recommended when using a GPU:
# --gpus all --ipc=host --ulimit memlock=-1 --ulimit stack=67108864

Note
----
Make sure you have docker version >= 19.03, a nvidia driver
and the nvidia container toolkit installed (see https://github.com/NVIDIA/nvidia-docker)
if you want to run the container with GPU support.
```
