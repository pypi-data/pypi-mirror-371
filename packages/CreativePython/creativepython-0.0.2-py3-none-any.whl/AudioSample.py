   the actual pitch, or fundamental frequency of the recorded sound (default is A4 - 69 or 440.0),

   Also, the sound object allows for polyphony - the default is 16 different voices, which can be played,
   pitch-shifted, looped, etc. indepedently from each other.  This way, we can play chords, etc., which is very nice.
   Finally, we can set/get its volume (0-127), panning (0-127), pitch (0-127), and frequency (in Hz).

# Note on cleanup: sounddevice itself has an atexit handler that terminates PortAudio.
# Our cleanupAudioSamples function is a best-effort attempt to explicitly close all
# AudioSample instances and their underlying RealtimeAudioPlayer streams before that.
# The RealtimeAudioPlayer.close() method is designed to be robust and will not error
# if PortAudio has already been terminated by sounddevice's cleanup, preventing crashes
# if our atexit handler runs after sounddevice's.
