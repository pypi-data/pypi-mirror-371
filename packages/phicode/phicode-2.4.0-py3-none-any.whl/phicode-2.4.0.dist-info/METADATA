# (φ) Phicode Engine

Below is a thorough look at what this engine does, how it's put together, designed & any "hidden"/less obvious behaviors

---

## What it is (at a glance)

Phicode lets you write Python using a symbolic alphabet (e.g., `¿` for `if`, `∴` for `try`, `π` for `print`) and run it as if it were normal Python. It does this by (1) **multi-tier transpiling** your `.φ` sources to Python (regex → optimized Python → Rust acceleration), (2) **enterprise-grade caching** with corruption recovery and integrity verification, (3) **seamless importing** `.φ` files via a custom meta-path finder/loader with full package support, and (4) **adaptive interpreter switching** (PyPy vs CPython) based on dependency analysis. The package also exposes an HTTP server with subprocess isolation and a comprehensive CLI.

This is a **production-ready symbolic Python runtime** with enterprise-grade engineering patterns—delivering **176M+ chars/sec** peak transpilation performance with optimization techniques found in major tech company codebases.

---

## My project philosophy

*"I believe in architectural minimalism with deterministic reliability - every line of code must earn its place through measurable value, not feature-rich design patterns. I build systems that work predictably in production, not demonstrations of architectural sophistication. My approach is surgical: target the exact problem with minimal code, reuse existing components rather than building new ones, and resist feature bloat by consistently asking whether each addition truly serves the core purpose. I favor synchronous, predictable flows over async complexity, apply optimizations only to proven bottlenecks with measurable impact, and choose tools based on performance characteristics that match workload requirements, not popular trends. I maintain strict separation of concerns across modules where each component has a single, well-defined responsibility, and preserve code readability and maintainability as primary concerns. My constraint-driven design ensures files never exceed 150 lines of code - complexity that cannot fit must be properly decomposed - and I design with cross-platform considerations and real-world deployment constraints in mind while implementing robust error handling without over-engineering every possible edge case. Production stability trumps cutting-edge patterns; I prioritize deterministic behavior and long-runtime stability over unpredictable innovation. I build what works, not what impresses."*

## Core capabilities

* **Multi-tier symbolic → Python transpilation.** The engine automatically selects optimal transpilation methods: Python regex for small files (<300KB), optimized Python with **frequency-based symbol ordering** (`_COMMON_SYMBOL_ORDER`) and **adaptive ordering** based on source analysis for medium files, and Rust acceleration for large files (300KB+) achieving **25M+ chars/sec** with **64-byte chunk processing** and **symbol byte scanning via memoryview**. It translates symbols using a configurable map covering control flow, built-ins, and pattern matching. Notably includes `match`/`case` (`⟷`, `▷`), built-ins like `ℓ`→`len`, `⟪`→`range`, `№`→`enumerate`, `⨅`→`zip`, `∑`→`sum`, `⭱`→`max`, `⭳`→`min`, `τ`→`type`, and the walrus operator (`≔`).

  The default symbol mapping ships in config and can be written to user config (`.(φ)/config.json`) via the config generator. **Custom mappings support complete language localization** with **ASCII identifier boundary detection** using `\b` regex anchors—you can map Python keywords to any language (e.g., `"True": "Verdadero"`, `"if": "si"` for Spanish) with **conflict detection**, **strict validation mode** (`PHICODE_STRICT`), and **logging deduplication** to prevent spam.

* **Enterprise-grade module importing.** A custom `MetaPathFinder`/`Loader` resolves **modules and full packages** (including `__init__.φ` files) with **LRU-decorated path resolution** (`@lru_cache(maxsize=256)`) in your project tree using `.φ` (primary) and `.py` (secondary) extensions. Features **comprehensive stdlib protection** using `sys.builtin_module_names` plus path filtering for site-packages/dist-packages/lib paths, **canonical path caching** with 1000-entry LRU limit (`_canon_cache`) to minimize filesystem operations, **spec caching with mtime validation** using `(spec, mtime)` tuples, and **cache clearing on finder deletion** via `__del__` method. Graceful fallback from `.φ` to `.py` files when needed.

* **Sophisticated caching architecture.** Features a **four-tier LRU cache hierarchy** with enterprise-grade reliability: (1) **raw source cache** with mmap for files >8KB and **exponential backoff retry logic** (3 attempts with 0.01s base delay), (2) **transpiled Python cache** with **xxhash acceleration** (MD5 fallback) and **symbol mapping hash keys**, (3) **import spec cache** with mtime validation, (4) **interpreter hint cache** for optimal runtime selection. 

  **Durability engineering**: **Cache eviction strategy** removes 25% or minimum 64 items when exceeding `CACHE_MAX_SIZE`. **Atomic writes** via tmp+rename+fsync pattern with **batched processing** (groups of 5) to minimize syscalls. **Integrity verification** using importlib-style headers with embedded source hashes, **marshal validation** for bytecode corruption detection, and **automatic cache rebuilding** on corruption. **Platform-optimized buffering** (128KB POSIX, 64KB Windows) with **move-to-end LRU optimization** for cache efficiency.

* **Intelligent interpreter management.** During transpilation, **dependency scanning** detects C-extensions (numpy/pandas/scipy/etc.) using import string analysis and **suggests/auto-switches** to CPython via **subprocess isolation** (`capture_output=True`); otherwise defaults to **PyPy** for speed. Switches use `-m phicode_engine <original_module> <args>` with **cache flush for safety** and **5-second timeout enforcement**. Includes **performance recommendations** with user guidance and **interpreter detection algorithm** checking available interpreters. Paths can be overridden by env (`PHITON_PATH` for CPython, `PHIPY_PATH` for PyPy).

* **Production-grade runtime ergonomics.** The runtime sets up **comprehensive signal handling** (SIGINT/SIGTERM) with **signal name mapping** for informative error messages, registers **shutdown hooks with reverse order execution** and **atexit registration**, installs the importer for the resolved source folder, **warns on slow startup** (>25ms), and ensures top-level `.φ` modules execute as `__main__` with **proper argument hygiene** via clean `argv` context management preventing global pollution. Features **resource cleanup redundancy** (hooks + destructors), **duplicate shutdown protection**, **temp file cleanup** in cache directories, **engine-branded syntax error wrapping** with source location preservation, and **runtime import failure recovery** with **module existence validation** and **automatic interpreter switching** for compatibility issues.

* **Security-first HTTP API & comprehensive CLI.** The **APHI server** exposes `/info`, `/symbols`, `/convert`, and `/execute` with **subprocess isolation** for security, **Content-Length validation** preventing empty request attacks, **JSON parsing error boundaries**, **UTF-8 encoding enforcement**, and **request field validation**. Checks engine availability and returns version/Python info (Phicode `2.2.0`). Supports **bidirectional conversion** (Python ↔ φ), **symbol mapping exposure** for tooling integration, and **remote execution with timeout protection**. 

  CLI features **early-exit flag handling**, **mutual exclusion groups** for interpreter selection (`--python`, `--pypy`, `--cpython`), **config management** (`--config-generate`, `--config-reset`), **performance debugging** (`--debug`), and **version management**. **Temporary argv context management** ensures clean argument passing to module `main()` functions.

* **Sophisticated Rust integration.** The **PhiRust accelerator** includes **automatic binary downloads** from GitHub releases with **cargo fallback compilation**, **performance benchmarking** with built-in speed measurement, **JSON encoder caching** using `frozenset` hashing to avoid repeated serialization, **symbol byte optimization** using 64-byte chunk processing for cache efficiency, and **graceful degradation** with seamless Python fallback. Binary installation includes **retry logic** and **filesystem safety checks**. A `RUST_SIZE_THRESHOLD` (300KB) determines when to prefer Rust for transpilation.

---

## Architecture & flow (how the pieces fit)

1. **Entry & initialization**: `phicode_engine.engine:main()` parses args with **early-exit handling** for version/help flags, toggles debug logging with **centralized control**, and hands off to `core.runtime.run()`.

2. **Runtime setup**: Registers **shutdown hooks with signal handling** (SIGINT/SIGTERM plus atexit), resolves your target (`main` module by default) to file or module with **`.φ`/`.py` detection**, **installs the Phicode importer** rooted at that folder with **canonical path optimization**, sets **main module designation** for correct `__main__` semantics, and includes **startup performance monitoring** with 25ms warning threshold.

3. **Import flow with LRU optimization**: `PhicodeFinder` maps `pkg.mod` to `<base>/pkg/mod.φ` (or `.py` as fallback) using **LRU-decorated path resolution**, **skips stdlib/site-packages with explicit protection** via `sys.builtin_module_names` filtering, **caches import specs with mtime validation** using `(spec, mtime)` tuples, and returns `spec` using `PhicodeLoader` for `.φ` files. Supports **full package hierarchies** with `__init__.φ` detection and **cache clearing on deletion**.

4. **Load/Exec with enterprise patterns**:
   * `PhicodeLoader` pulls source from `PhicodeCache` (four-tier LRU with **canonical path caching**), transpiles to Python with **multi-tier optimization** and **symbol frequency analysis**, optionally triggers **interpreter switching with subprocess isolation**, compiles via `BytecodeManager` with **integrity verification** and **marshal validation**, then hands to `ModuleExecutor`, marking `__main__` if it matches the initial module. **Syntax errors wrapped with engine branding**.
   * `ModuleExecutor` runs the code object with **proper argument context management**; if the resolved target was a **Python module** (not `.φ`) and exposes `main()`, the runtime calls it with **temporary `argv` shim** for clean argument passing.

5. **Caching architecture with reliability engineering**:
   * `PhicodeCache` is a **four-tier LRU** over: (a) raw source with **mmap optimization** (>8KB threshold), **exponential backoff retry logic** (3 attempts), and **platform-specific buffering**, (b) transpiled Python with **xxhash/MD5 hashing** and **symbol mapping keys**, (c) import specs with **mtime-based invalidation**, (d) interpreter hints for **performance optimization**. Uses **canonical path caching** (1000 entries), **cache eviction strategy** (25% or 64 items), and **move-to-end LRU optimization**.
   * `BytecodeManager` decides **hashed cache paths** under `.(φ)cache/comφled_<impl>_<pyver>/`, validates headers with **importlib format + source hashes**, **batches writes** (groups of 5) with **atomic operations** (tmp+rename+fsync), includes **marshal validation** and **corruption detection with automatic recovery**. A `__del__` on the finder flushes as a safety net.

---

## Design choices

* **Meta-importer with LRU optimization.** Using a `MetaPathFinder` makes `.φ` feel first-class alongside Python packages and supports **full packages with `__init__.φ`**. **LRU decorators on path resolution** (`@lru_cache(maxsize=256)`) plus **canonical path caching** (1000 entries) and **mtime-based spec caching** dramatically reduce filesystem chatter.

* **Enterprise-grade defensive programming.** **Multiple fallback layers** at every level: batching + tmp-rename + fsync = practical durability without excessive syscalls. **Exponential backoff** (3 attempts, 0.01s base delay) handles transient file system issues. **Marshal validation** and **corruption recovery** ensure sources run even if caching fails. **Resource cleanup redundancy** (shutdown hooks + destructors + atexit) prevents leaks. **Graceful degradation** when optional components fail.

* **Performance-first architecture with byte-level optimization.** **Multi-tier acceleration** with automatic method selection, **symbol frequency estimation** with `_COMMON_SYMBOL_ORDER` for dynamic ordering, **memoryview byte-level detection** avoiding string operations, **64-byte chunk processing** in Rust, and **xxhash preference** with MD5 fallback. Import-string sniffing to choose PyPy vs CPython is simple yet effective, with **intelligent performance recommendations**.

* **Developer experience excellence.** Logging consistently branded with `(φ)`, debug enabled centrally, symbol mapping generated/reset via user-editable JSON. **Startup performance monitoring** warns when boot exceeds 25ms. **Error context preservation** with engine branding, **argument passing hygiene** preventing global state pollution, and **comprehensive exception handling** in all critical paths.

---

## Hidden/less obvious features & behaviors

* **Symbol coverage goes beyond keywords.** You don't just get `if/for/try`; many **built-ins** and utilities have symbols (e.g., `ℓ`, `№`, `⨅`, `∑`, `⭱`, `⭳`, `τ`). This makes `.φ` viable for concise algorithmic code without constant back-and-forth to Python names.

* **Multi-location config discovery with filesystem resilience.** Looks for `.(φ)/config.json` (primary) and `.phicode/config.json` (fallback), helping environments that dislike special characters in directory names. **Config generation includes filesystem safety checks**.

* **Four-tier cache intelligence with enterprise patterns.** Beyond basic spec caching, includes **interpreter hint caching** for optimal runtime selection, **transpilation caching** with **symbol mapping hash keys** using `frozenset`, and **source caching** with **canonical path optimization**. **Integrity verification** uses **marshal validation** with **automatic corruption recovery** and **cache rebuilding**.

* **Comprehensive lifecycle management with redundancy.** Batch cache writes registered as **shutdown hooks** with **reverse order execution**, **signal handlers** for SIGINT/SIGTERM with **signal name mapping**, **atexit registration** for additional safety, **redundant cleanup** via finder destructors, **resource cleanup with proper ordering** and **exception handling**, **duplicate shutdown protection**, and **temp file cleanup** in cache directories.

* **API server security architecture with process isolation.** HTTP endpoints mirror CLI functions with **subprocess isolation** (`capture_output=True`) for safety, **Content-Length validation** preventing empty requests, **JSON parsing error boundaries**, **UTF-8 encoding enforcement**, **request field validation**, and **5-second timeout enforcement**. `/symbols` and `/convert` expose transpiler functionality; server delegates heavy lifting to controlled subprocess for **input validation** and **resource limits**.

* **Advanced symbol configuration with conflict resolution.** Custom mappings support **ASCII identifier detection** with `\b` regex anchors, **conflict validation** with warnings, **strict validation mode** (`PHICODE_STRICT` env var), **complete language localization**, and **logging deduplication** to prevent spam. **Symbol frequency estimation** enables **dynamic ordering** for performance optimization with **adaptive symbol ordering** based on source analysis.

* **Multi-tier performance optimization with byte-level scanning.** Engine uses **memoryview for byte-level** symbol detection avoiding string operations, **64-byte chunk processing** for cache efficiency in Rust, **adaptive symbol ordering** based on usage patterns, **xxhash acceleration** with MD5 fallback for fast hashing, **JSON encoder caching** using `frozenset` hashing, and **platform-specific buffer optimization** (128KB POSIX, 64KB Windows).

* **Extensive environment-driven configuration with performance tuning.** Cache behavior tunable via `PHICODE_CACHE_SIZE` (LRU limits), `PHICODE_MMAP_THRESHOLD` (8KB default), `PHICODE_BATCH_SIZE` (5 default). Import analysis toggleable with `PHICODE_IMPORT_ANALYSIS`, validation with `PHICODE_VALIDATION`/`PHICODE_STRICT`, interpreter paths via `PHITON_PATH`/`PHIPY_PATH`, and performance thresholds via `RUST_SIZE_THRESHOLD`/`STARTUP_WARNING_MS`.

* **Rust integration sophistication with automatic management.** PhiRust accelerator includes **automatic binary downloads** from GitHub releases with **retry logic**, **cargo fallback compilation** with timeout handling, **performance benchmarking** with built-in measurement, **JSON encoder caching** to avoid re-serialization, **symbol byte optimization** for non-ASCII detection, and **size threshold activation** ensuring optimal performance across file sizes.

* **Runtime import failure recovery with intelligent fallback.** **Module existence validation** via `importlib.find_spec()` distinguishes between missing modules (typos) and compatibility issues. **Interpreter environment detection** identifies non-CPython runtimes (PyPy, etc.) and automatically attempts **runtime interpreter switching** to CPython for compatibility. **Multi-layer error messaging** with branded warnings for switch attempts, comprehensive error context for failures, and **actionable user guidance** including current interpreter identification and compatibility recommendations.

* **Package support depth with priority ordering.** Full `__init__.φ` support for proper package hierarchies, **LRU-decorated package detection**, **graceful fallback** from `.φ` to `.py` files, **canonical path caching** to minimize filesystem operations, and **spec caching with mtime validation** for efficient imports.

---

## Performance posture

* **Multi-tier fast path with byte-level optimization**: Symbol transpile (tier selection with **frequency analysis**) → AST parse → `compile(..., optimize=2)` → batch queue write; subsequent runs: validate header+hash → load code object → exec. **Rust acceleration** for large files delivers **176M+ chars/sec** peak performance (validated benchmarks) with **64-byte chunk processing**. **Symbol byte scanning** via memoryview avoids string operations. Quite zippy, especially with PyPy on symbol-heavy code.

* **I/O discipline with enterprise reliability.** Large reads use **mmap with graceful fallback** to buffered reads. File ops include **exponential backoff** (3 attempts, 0.01s base delay) for EBUSY/EAGAIN scenarios. **Platform-specific buffering** (128KB POSIX, 64KB Windows) maximizes throughput. **Atomic writes** with tmp+rename+fsync ensure durability. **Marshal validation** prevents corrupted bytecode execution.

* **Startup optimization with monitoring.** Warns if boot takes >25ms, giving developers nudges when import graphs or disk are slow. **Cache warmup strategies** with **LRU path resolution**, **lazy compilation**, **canonical path caching** (1000 entries), and **spec caching with mtime validation** minimize cold-start overhead.

* **Symbol processing optimization with frequency analysis.** **Common symbols processed first** (`_COMMON_SYMBOL_ORDER`), **frequency-based ordering** for dynamic workloads, **adaptive symbol ordering** based on source analysis, **byte-level scanning** with memoryview, **64-byte chunk processing**, and **ASCII identifier boundary detection** using `\b` regex anchors avoid unnecessary string operations.

* **Scaling architecture with intelligent selection.** Multi-tier handles files from KB to GB: Python regex for small files, optimized Python with **symbol frequency analysis** and caching for medium files, **Rust acceleration** for large files (>300KB) delivering **176M+ peak, 2-5M sustained chars/sec**. **Cache eviction strategy** (25% or 64 items) and **xxhash/MD5 hashing** maintain performance at scale.

---

## Developer experience (DX)

* **Rich debugging capabilities with comprehensive logging.** Toggle `--debug` for verbose logs with `(φ)`-branded messages; **early-exit flag handling** before full parsing for performance; flags like `--version`/`--list-interpreters`/`--show-versions` supported. **Interpreter-specific flags** (`--python`, `--pypy`, `--cpython`) with **mutual exclusion groups** provide fine-grained control.

* **Clean abstractions with state isolation.** **Argument passing** to Python module `main()` handled via **temporary `argv` context manager** (no global leakage). **Error context preservation** with **engine-branded syntax error wrapping**, **startup performance insights** with timing analysis, and **comprehensive exception handling** in all critical paths.

* **Integration-friendly server with security isolation.** APHI server exposes conversion/symbols/execute, useful for editor integrations to "show me the Python" or run snippets remotely. **Configurable ports**, **subprocess isolation** (`capture_output=True`), **timeout enforcement** (5s), and **input validation** ensure security.

* **Configuration management with validation.** Generate default configs with `--config-generate`, reset with `--config-reset`. **Complete language localization** support enables writing Python in any natural language through custom keyword mappings with **conflict detection** and **strict validation mode**. **Filesystem safety checks** prevent corruption.

* **Performance insights with monitoring.** Built-in **startup monitoring** (25ms warning), **cache hit rate tracking** via LRU optimization, **interpreter recommendation system** with PyPy preference logic, and **performance benchmarking** in Rust integration help optimize development workflows.

* **Import system stdlib protection.** Comprehensive detection using `sys.builtin_module_names` plus path filtering for site-packages, dist-packages, lib/python, and `sys.prefix` paths to prevent accidental interference with standard library imports.

---

## Configuration & customization

* **Symbol mapping flexibility with conflict resolution.** Engine supports complete keyword remapping—from Unicode symbols to natural language keywords. Examples: `{"True": "Verdadero", "False": "Falso", "if": "si"}` for Spanish, or mathematical symbols like `{"for": "∀", "in": "∈"}`. **ASCII identifier detection** with `\b` boundary anchors, **conflict validation** with **logging deduplication**, and **strict mode** (`PHICODE_STRICT`) treating conflicts as errors.

* **Validation modes with comprehensive detection.** `PHICODE_VALIDATION=true` enables symbol conflict detection; `PHICODE_STRICT=true` treats conflicts as errors rather than warnings. **Logging deduplication** prevents spam from repeated conflicts.

* **Performance tuning with platform optimization.** Environment variables control cache behavior (`PHICODE_CACHE_SIZE=512` for LRU limits), memory mapping threshold (`PHICODE_MMAP_THRESHOLD=8192`), batch sizes (`PHICODE_BATCH_SIZE=5`), **platform-specific buffering** (128KB POSIX, 64KB Windows), and Rust threshold (`RUST_SIZE_THRESHOLD=300000`).

* **Interpreter preferences with detection override.** Override **dependency analysis** with `PHITON_PATH` for CPython and `PHIPY_PATH` for PyPy. Import analysis disabled with `PHICODE_IMPORT_ANALYSIS=false`. **Performance recommendations** guide optimal interpreter selection.

* **Development toggles with monitoring control.** Debug modes, validation strictness, feature flags, **startup monitoring thresholds** (`STARTUP_WARNING_MS=25`), **retry configuration** (`MAX_FILE_RETRIES=3`, `RETRY_BASE_DELAY=0.01`), and **cache optimization settings** provide fine-grained control over engine behavior without code changes.
