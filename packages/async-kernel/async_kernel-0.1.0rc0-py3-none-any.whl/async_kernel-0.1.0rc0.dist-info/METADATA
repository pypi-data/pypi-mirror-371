Async kernel is a Python [Jupyter kernel](https://docs.jupyter.org/en/latest/projects/kernels.html#kernels-programming-languages) that runs in an [anyio](https://pypi.org/project/anyio/) event loop.

## Highlights

- Concurrent message handling
- [Debugger client](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/debugger.html#debugger)
- Configurable backend - "asyncio" (default) or "trio backend" [^config-backend]
- [IPython shell](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.html#enhanced-interactive-python-shell) provides:
    - code execution
    - magic
    - code completions
    - history

## Installation

```shell
pip install async-kernel
```

### Trio

To add a kernel spec for `trio`.

```shell
pip install trio
```

```shell
async-kernel -a async-trio
```

## Origin

Async kernel started as a [fork](https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel/commit/8322a7684b004ee95f07b2f86f61e28146a5996d)
of [IPyKernel](https://github.com/ipython/ipykernel). Thank you to the original contributors of IPyKernel that made Async kernel possible.
