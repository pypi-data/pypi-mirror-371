üß¨ GeneAgent Analysis ‚Äî Exact Original Implementation (7 Steps)
Target genes: {gene_str}

FOLLOW EXACT ORIGINAL GENEAGENT WORKFLOW:

üìã TODO MANAGEMENT (use for tracking):
- add_todo() - Add the 7 GeneAgent analysis steps
- show_todos() - Display current progress  
- execute_current_task() - Get guidance for current step
- mark_task_done() - Mark each step complete

STEP-BY-STEP EXECUTION (MUST FOLLOW ORDER):

STEP 1: Generate Baseline Analysis
- Use exact baseline prompt: "Write a critical analysis of the biological processes performed by this system of interacting proteins. Propose a brief name for the most prominent biological process performed by the system. Put the name at the top of the analysis as 'Process: <name>'. Be concise, do not use unnecessary words. Be textual, do not use any format symbols such as '*', '-' or other tokens. Be specific, avoid overly general statements such as 'the proteins are involved in various cellular processes'. Be factual, do not editorialize. For each important point, describe your reasoning and supporting information. For each biological function name, show the corresponding gene names. Here is the gene set: {gene_str}"
- Save as: baseline_summary

STEP 2: Extract Process & Generate Topic Claims  
- Extract process name from baseline_summary (split by "Process: ")
- Generate topic claims using prompt: "Here is the original process name for the gene set {gene_str}: [PROCESS_NAME]. However, the process name might be false. Please generate decontextualized claims for the process name that need to be verified. Only Return a list type that contain all generated claim strings, for example, ['claim_1', 'claim_2']. Only generate claims with affirmative sentence for the entire gene set. The gene set should only be separated by comma, e.g. 'a,b,c'. Don't generate claims for the single gene or incomplete gene set. Don't generate hypotheis claims over the previous analysis. Please replace the statement like 'these genes', 'this system' with the core genes in the given gene set."
- Save as: topic_claims (list format)

STEP 3: Verify Topic Claims (First Iteration)
- For each claim in topic_claims:
  - Call: gene_agent.verify_biological_claim(claim)
  - Collect all verification results
- Concatenate as: verification_topic = "Original_claim:[claim1]Verified_claim:[result1]Original_claim:[claim2]Verified_claim:[result2]..."

STEP 4: Modify Analysis Based on Verification
- Use modification prompt: "I have finished the verification for process name. Here is the verification report: [verification_topic]. You should only consider the successfully verified claims. If claims are supported, you should retain the original process name and only can make a minor grammar revision. if claims are partially supported, you should discard the unsupported part. If claims are refuted, you must replace the original process name with the most significant (i.e., top-1) biological function term summarized from the verification report. Meanwhile, revise the original summaries using the verified (or updated) process name. Do not use sentence like 'There are no direct evidence to...'. Put the updated process name at the top of the analysis as 'Process: <name>'. Be concise, do not use unnecessary words. Be textual, do not use any format symbols such as '*', '-' or other tokens. All modified sentence should encoded into utf-8. Be specific, avoid overly general statements such as 'the proteins are involved in various cellular processes'. Be factual, do not editorialize. You must retain the gene names of each updated biological functions in the new summary."
- Save as: updated_analysis

STEP 5: Generate Analysis Claims (Second Iteration)
- Use analysis prompt: "Here is the summary of the given gene set: [updated_analysis]. However, the gene analysis in the summary might not support the updated process name. Please generate several decontextualized claims for the analytical narratives that need to be verified. Only Return a list type that contain all generated claim strings, for example, ['claim_1', 'claim_2']. Generate claims for genes and their biological functions around the updated process name. Don't generate claims for the entire gene set or 'this system'. Don't generate unworthy claims such as the summarization and reasoning over the previous analysis. Claims must contain the gene names and their biological process functions."
- Save as: analysis_claims (list format)

STEP 6: Verify Analysis Claims (Second Iteration)  
- For each claim in analysis_claims:
  - Call: gene_agent.verify_biological_claim(claim)
  - Collect all verification results
- Concatenate as: verification_analysis = "Original_claim:[claim1]Verified_claim:[result1]Original_claim:[claim2]Verified_claim:[result2]..."

STEP 7: Final Summarization
- Use summarization prompt: "I have finished the verification for the revised summary. Here is the verification report: [verification_analysis]. Please modify the summary according to the verification report again. If the analytical narratives of genes can't directly support or related to the updated process name, you must propose a new brief biological process name from the analytical texts. Otherwise, you must retain the updated process name and only can make a grammar revision. IF the claim is supported, you must complement the narratives by using the standard evidence of gene set functions (or gene summaries) in the verification report but don't change the updated process name. IF the claim is not supported, do not mention any statement like '... was not directly confirmed by...'. Be concise, do not use unnecessary format like **, only return the concise texts."
- Save as: final_analysis

EXECUTION PLAN:
1) add_todo("Step 1: Generate baseline analysis using original prompt")
2) add_todo("Step 2: Extract process name and generate topic claims") 
3) add_todo("Step 3: Verify topic claims with biological APIs")
4) add_todo("Step 4: Modify analysis based on verification results")
5) add_todo("Step 5: Generate analysis claims from updated summary")
6) add_todo("Step 6: Verify analysis claims with biological APIs") 
7) add_todo("Step 7: Final summarization with verification evidence")

For each step:
- execute_current_task() for guidance

BRCA1 and BRCA2 function in homologous recombination DNA repair, maintaining genomic stability through direct participation in DNA double-strand break repair mechanisms. EGFR acts as a receptor tyrosine kinase that transduces extracellular growth signals through downstream signaling cascades including PI3K/AKT and RAS/MAPK pathways.

The functional integration of these proteins creates a regulatory network where DNA damage surveillance (TP53, BRCA1, BRCA2) intersects with growth factor signaling (EGFR) to maintain cellular homeostasis. When this network is disrupted through mutations, cells can acquire hallmarks of cancer including resistance to apoptosis and sustained proliferative signaling.
