- **`IValidationStrategy`** - Contract for threat validation implementations
- **`IThreatAggregator`** - Contract for threat aggregation and deduplication

### ðŸŸ¢ **Application Layer Components** (Use Cases & Coordination)

#### **Adapters** (`src/adversary_mcp_server/application/adapters/`)
Bridge domain interfaces with infrastructure implementations:

- **`SemgrepScanStrategy`** - Adapts SemgrepScanner to domain IScanStrategy interface

### **Clean Architecture Benefits Achieved**

#### âœ… **Dependency Inversion**
- Domain layer has no dependencies on external frameworks
- Infrastructure depends on domain interfaces, not concrete implementations
- Adapters translate between domain concepts and external systems

#### âœ… **Separation of Concerns**
- Business rules isolated in domain services
- Infrastructure concerns separated from business logic
- UI/API concerns handled at application boundaries

#### âœ… **Testability**
- Domain logic tested independently with unit tests
- Integration tests validate adapter and infrastructure layers
- Mock strategies enable fast, reliable testing

#### âœ… **Flexibility & Maintainability**
- Easy to swap infrastructure implementations (different scanners, databases)
- Domain logic changes don't require infrastructure modifications
- Clear boundaries make understanding and modification easier

### Data Flow Architecture

#### Standard Scanning Workflow
1. **Input Processing**: Code/file received via MCP tool or CLI
2. **Parallel Analysis**: SemgrepScanner and LLMScanner execute concurrently
3. **Result Collection**: ThreatMatch objects collected from both scanners
4. **Validation Processing**: LLMValidator analyzes findings for legitimacy
5. **False Positive Filtering**: Validated results filtered by confidence threshold
6. **Exploit Generation**: Confirmed vulnerabilities enhanced with POCs
7. **Result Synthesis**: EnhancedScanResult with metadata and statistics
8. **Client Response**: Formatted results returned to Cursor IDE or CLI

#### Git Diff-Aware Scanning
1. **Branch Analysis**: GitDiffScanner extracts changed lines between branches
2. **Context Building**: Full file context built around changed lines
3. **Targeted Scanning**: Only new/modified code analyzed by scan engines
4. **Line Mapping**: Results mapped back to original file line numbers
5. **Validation & Enhancement**: Same validation workflow as standard scanning

#### LLM Validation Workflow
1. **Finding Collection**: Threats from all scanners aggregated
2. **Prompt Generation**: Structured validation prompts created
3. **Client Analysis**: Prompts sent to client-side LLM for analysis
4. **Result Parsing**: JSON responses parsed into ValidationResult objects
5. **Confidence Filtering**: Findings below threshold marked as false positives
6. **Enhancement**: Legitimate findings enhanced with exploitation details

### Key Features

#### Multi-Engine Analysis
- **Complementary Coverage**: Static analysis + AI reasoning + validation
- **Intelligent Deduplication**: Similar findings merged across engines
- **Confidence Scoring**: Each finding assigned reliability metrics
- **Smart Result Merging**: Best-of-breed approach for maximum accuracy

#### Advanced Validation System
- **False Positive Reduction**: LLMValidator filters noise with 70% default confidence threshold

- **Data Persistence**: False positive information stored directly in `.adversary.json` files
- **Performance Optimization**: Intelligent caching with automatic cache invalidation
- **Statistics & Reporting**: Comprehensive false positive analytics and reporting

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component testing with mocks
- **Integration Tests**: Full workflow testing with real files
- **Security Tests**: Validate detection accuracy and exploit safety
- **Validation Tests**: Comprehensive LLMValidator functionality testing
- **Coverage**: Maintain 75%+ test coverage requirement
- **Markers**: Tests marked as `unit`, `integration`, `security`, `slow`

### Development Guidelines

#### Code Organization
- All source code in `src/adversary_mcp_server/`
- Comprehensive type hints required (mypy strict mode)
- Follow black formatting and isort import organization
- Use pydantic for data validation and serialization

#### Security Considerations
- This is a **defensive security tool** only
- Exploit generation includes safety warnings and educational context
- All analysis focuses on vulnerability detection and remediation
- No malicious code generation or attack facilitation
- LLM validation runs client-side (no API keys transmitted)

#### Error Handling
- Use `AdversaryToolError` for tool-specific failures
- Comprehensive logging with structured messages
- Graceful degradation when LLM analysis unavailable
- Input validation using pydantic models
- Fail-safe validation (unknown findings kept when validation fails)

#### SSL/TLS and Corporate Environment Support
- **Truststore Integration**: Both CLI and MCP entry points inject `truststore.inject_into_ssl()` for corporate CA support
- **Netskope Compatibility**: Automatic SSL context injection handles corporate SSL inspection tools
- **Entry Point Coverage**:
  - CLI (`clean_cli.py::main()`) - Injected before any CLI operations
  - MCP Server (`sync_main.py::main()`) - Injected before MCP server startup
- **Graceful Fallback**: Missing truststore package falls back to system SSL configuration
- **Network Client Support**: All OpenAI/Anthropic API calls inherit the enhanced SSL context
- **Error Resilience**: Failed truststore injection logs debug messages but doesn't block execution

### MCP Integration

The server provides tools for Cursor IDE through the MCP protocol:
- Configure in `.cursor/mcp.json` with Python path and environment variables
- Tools accept structured parameters with validation
- Results include detailed findings, metadata, and remediation guidance
- Validation can be enabled/disabled per scan operation
- **Automatic Persistence**: All scan tools automatically create `.adversary.*` files alongside scanned code
- **Multi-Format Support**: `output_format` parameter supports `json`, `md`, `markdown`, `csv` formats
- **Persistence Metadata**: MCP responses include persistence information (file path, format, success status)
- Hot-reload capability for real-time rule updates during development

### MCP Tool Design Patterns

**IMPORTANT**: Each MCP tool has a unique workflow and should NOT be implemented as abstractions of each other:

#### Directory Scan (`adv_scan_directory`)
- **Purpose**: Directory-level security analysis
- **Workflow**: Scan entire directory as single unit, return directory-level results
- **Implementation**: Uses `semgrep.scan_directory()` and `llm.analyze_directory()` directly
- **Output**: Single `EnhancedScanResult` with directory-level threats and metadata
- **DO NOT**: Process files individually within directory scan workflow

#### File Scan (`adv_scan_file`)
- **Purpose**: Individual file security analysis
- **Workflow**: Scan single file, return file-level results
- **Implementation**: Uses `semgrep.scan_file()` and `llm.analyze_file()` directly
- **Output**: Single `EnhancedScanResult` with file-level threats and metadata
- **DO NOT**: Iterate through directories within file scan workflow

#### Code Scan (`adv_scan_code`)
- **Purpose**: Code snippet security analysis
- **Workflow**: Scan code string, return code-level results
- **Implementation**: Uses `semgrep.scan_code()` and `llm.analyze_code()` directly
- **Output**: Single `EnhancedScanResult` with code-level threats and metadata
- **DO NOT**: Persist code to files or abstract to file/directory scanning

**Anti-Pattern**: Directory scan calling file scan repeatedly, or file scan abstracting to code scan. Each tool should have its own complete, optimized workflow for maximum performance and clarity.

### CLI Integration

Full command-line interface with validation support:
- `--use-validation/--no-validation` flags control LLM validation
- `--use-llm/--no-llm` and `--use-semgrep/--no-semgrep` control scan engines
- **Automatic Persistence**: All CLI scan commands automatically create `.adversary.*` files alongside scanned code
- **Multi-Format Support**: `--output-format` parameter supports `json`, `markdown`, `csv` formats
- **Verbose Reporting**: `--verbose` flag shows persistence file locations and status
- Status command shows validation availability and configuration
- Git diff scanning fully supported with validation
- JSON output includes validation statistics and metadata

- I want to define something called a symmetry test. I want the symmetry test, when I ask for it, to test both the MCP tool as well as the scan tool and ensure that both of the scan results with the same configuration come back symmetrical. This way we know that the CLI interface and the MCP tool interface are both getting the same results back to the user. I want to do this for the file tool and the scan file logic in the CLI, and I want to do it for the folder tool and the scan subcommand in the CLI pointing to that folder. Can you help remember so that when I say symmetry test, you know to perform these things?
- Make sure that when I call for a symmetry test, we target the examples/ subfolder in the project. Pick any file within that folder for your file testing.
- use your Bash and my MCP tools as part of the testing when I call for a symmetry test.

- Please do not use any inline import statement. All imports should go at the top of the file and be ordered with pythonic order.

- No raw SQL statements are allowed in this codebase. every database interaction must use sqlalchemy.
