    A wrapper on *pika*, an implementation of the subscriber side of a *RabbitMQ* client.

    This is an example of a consumer that can handle unexpected interactions with *RabbitMQ*,
    such as channel closing and connection interruptions.

    If *RabbitMQ* closes the connection, this object will stop and indicate that reconnecting is required.
    In this case, the execution log should be examined, as the reasons why the connection can be
    closed are limited, and are often tied to permissions-related issues, or to socket timeouts.
    If the channel is closed, it indicates a problem with one of the commands that were issued.
