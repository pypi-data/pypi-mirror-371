"""GroupBy module for organizing and aggregating collections of items.

This module provides the GroupBy class, which represents the result of a
group_by operation on a Collection. It organizes items into groups based on
specified keys and enables aggregation operations across those groups.

The GroupBy class implements a dictionary-like interface, allowing access to
individual groups through key lookup, iteration, and standard dictionary
methods like keys(), values(), and items().

Example:
    ```python
    # Group runs by model type
    grouped = runs.group_by("model.type")

    # Access a specific group
    transformer_runs = grouped["transformer"]

    # Iterate through groups
    for model_type, group in grouped.items():
        print(f"Model: {model_type}, Runs: {len(group)}")

    # Perform aggregations
    stats = grouped.agg(
        "accuracy",
        "loss",
        avg_time=lambda g: sum(r.get("runtime") for r in g) / len(g)
    )
    ```

The GroupBy class supports aggregation through the agg() method, which can
compute both predefined metrics from the grouped items and custom aggregations
specified as callables.
