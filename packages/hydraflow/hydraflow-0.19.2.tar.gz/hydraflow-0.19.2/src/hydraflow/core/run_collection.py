"""RunCollection module for HydraFlow.

This module provides the RunCollection class, which represents a collection
of MLflow Runs in HydraFlow. RunCollection offers functionality for filtering,
sorting, grouping, and analyzing runs, as well as converting run data to
various formats such as DataFrames.

The RunCollection class implements the Sequence protocol, allowing it to be
used like a standard Python list while providing specialized methods for
working with Run instances.

Example:
    ```python
    # Create a collection from a list of runs
    runs = RunCollection([run1, run2, run3])

    # Filter runs based on criteria
    filtered = runs.filter(("metrics.accuracy", lambda acc: acc > 0.9))

    # Sort runs by specific keys
    sorted_runs = runs.sort("metrics.accuracy", reverse=True)

    # Group runs by model type
    grouped = runs.group_by("model.type")

    # Compute aggregates on grouped data
    metrics_df = grouped.agg(
        avg_acc=lambda rc: sum(r.get("metrics.accuracy") for r in rc) / len(rc)
    )

    # Convert runs to a DataFrame for analysis
    df = runs.to_frame("run_id", "model.type", "metrics.accuracy")
    ```

Note:
    This module requires Polars and NumPy for DataFrame operations and
    numerical computations.

        access these properties, as they will be already loaded in memory.

            which is suitable for I/O-bound tasks like loading
            configuration files and implementation objects.

        Examples:
            ```python
            # Preload all runs sequentially
            runs.preload()

            # Preload using all available cores
