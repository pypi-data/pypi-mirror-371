# Instructions

Install the note type Chess 2.0
[thus](https://github.com/TowelSniffer/Anki-Chess-2.0/blob/main/documentation/installation.md).
Run `pip install pgnanki`, and in Python run something like the following.

```Python
import io

import chess.pgn
import pgnanki

pgn = """[FEN "r1bq1bkr/ppp3pp/2n5/3np3/2B5/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 2 8"]

8. Bxd5+ (8. Qxd5+ Qxd5 (8... Be6 9. Qxe6#) 9. Bxd5+ Be6 10. Bxe6#) 8... Qxd5
(8... Be6 9. Bxe6#) 9. Qxd5+ Be6 10. Qxe6# *"""

with io.StringIO(pgn) as stream:
    game = chess.pgn.read_game(stream)
with open("Fried-Liver-Attack.tsv", "x") as file:
    for line in pgnanki.yield_lines(game, opposite=False):
        print(line, file=file)
```

This example would write to a file named `Fried-Liver-Attack.tsv` the following.

```TSV
#separator:tab
#html:false
#notetype:Chess 2.0
[FEN "r4bkr/ppp3pp/2n1b3/3Qp3/8/8/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 10"] 10. Qxe6# *
[FEN "r1b2bkr/ppp3pp/2n5/3qp3/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 0 9"] 9. Qxd5+ Be6 10. Qxe6# *
[FEN "r2q1bkr/ppp3pp/2n1b3/3Bp3/8/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 1 9"] 9. Bxe6# *
[FEN "r1bq1bkr/ppp3pp/2n5/3np3/2B5/5Q2/PPPP1PPP/RNB1K2R w KQ - 2 8"] 8. Bxd5+ ( 8. Qxd5+ Qxd5 ( 8... Be6 9. Qxe6# ) 9. Bxd5+ Be6 10. Bxe6# ) 8... Qxd5 ( 8... Be6 9. Bxe6# ) 9. Qxd5+ Be6 10. Qxe6# *
```

In Anki
1. Click 'File' and 'Import...'.
2. Choose the file like `Fried-Liver-Attack.tsv`.
3. In the dialogue box 'Import File''s section 'Import options' choose the deck.
4. Click Import.
