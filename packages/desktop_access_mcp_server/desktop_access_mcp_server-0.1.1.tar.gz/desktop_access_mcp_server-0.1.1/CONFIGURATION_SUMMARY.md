# Desktop Access MCP Server - Configuration Summary

## Problem
When trying to run the package with `uvx desktop_access_mcp_server`, you get the error:
```
Package `desktop-access-mcp-server` does not provide any executables.
```

## Root Cause
The issue was that the package wasn't properly configured to expose its console scripts when used with uvx.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Package Configuration
Modified `pyproject.toml` to properly define entry points using the modern format:

```toml
[project.scripts]
desktop-access-mcp-server = "desktop_access_mcp_server.entry_point:run_server"
desktop-cli = "desktop_access_mcp_server.cli_entry_point:run_cli"
```

### 2. Maintained Backward Compatibility
Kept the existing `setup.cfg` for traditional installation methods.

### 3. Updated Documentation
Modified README.md to include proper usage instructions for both installation methods.

## Usage Instructions

### Method 1: Direct Execution (After Installation)
1. Build the package:
   ```bash
   python -m build
   ```

2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   pip install dist/desktop_access_mcp_server-0.1.0-py3-none-any.whl
   ```

3. Run the server:
   ```bash
   desktop-access-mcp-server
   ```

### Method 2: Using uvx (No Installation Required)
Run directly with uvx:
```bash
uvx --from desktop-access-mcp-server desktop-access-mcp-server
```

## Verification
A test script was created to verify the server works correctly with both methods:
- `test_mcp_server.py` - Tests server startup and graceful shutdown

## Additional Features
- CLI interface for testing: `desktop-cli`
- Full MCP compliance for integration with LLM agents
- Cross-platform support (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Comprehensive logging and error handling

## MCP Tools Available
1. `take_screenshot` - Capture desktop screenshots
2. `keyboard_input` - Simulate keyboard input
3. `mouse_action` - Control mouse movements and clicks
