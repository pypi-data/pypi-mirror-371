# JSON Configuration Support - Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated README.md
- Added a new section "JSON Configuration for MCP Clients" 
- Included specific instructions for Claude Desktop configuration
- Added generic configuration template for other MCP clients
- Added reference to the new configuration guide in the Resources section

### 2. Updated MCP_SERVER_USAGE.md
- Added JSON configuration section with examples for both uvx and direct execution
- Included configuration file locations for different platforms
- Maintained all existing usage instructions

### 3. Created New Documentation
- **CLAUDE_DESKTOP_CONFIG.md**: Comprehensive guide for configuring Claude Desktop with this MCP server
- **test_config.json**: Sample JSON configuration file for testing

## Configuration Details

### Claude Desktop Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "desktop-access": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": [
        "--from",
        "desktop-access-mcp-server",
        "desktop-access-mcp-server"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Direct Installation Configuration
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "desktop-access": {
      "command": "desktop-access-mcp-server"
    }
  }
}
```

## File Locations

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/mcp-config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\mcp-config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/mcp-config.json`

## Verification

The configuration has been designed to work with:
- Claude Desktop
- Any MCP client that supports JSON configuration
- Both installed and uvx-based execution methods

## Security Note

The JSON configuration approach maintains the same security model as direct execution, providing full desktop access capabilities to trusted LLM agents.
