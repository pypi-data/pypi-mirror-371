"""
Systematic Rule Verification Tests

This module tests each tableau rule in isolation according to the formal
specifications in RULE_SPECIFICATION.md. Each rule is tested for:
1. Minimal case (simplest formula that triggers the rule)
2. Non-application (verify rule doesn't fire when it shouldn't)
3. Exact output verification
4. Branch structure verification (for branching rules)
5. Sign propagation

These tests verify the implementation matches Ferguson (2021) exactly.
