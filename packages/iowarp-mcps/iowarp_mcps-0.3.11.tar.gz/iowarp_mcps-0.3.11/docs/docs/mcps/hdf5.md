### 1. Scientific Data Structure Analysis
```
I have an HDF5 file containing simulation results at /data/climate_simulation.h5. Can you analyze its structure and show me what datasets are available?
```

**Tools called:**
- `inspect_hdf5` - Analyze the HDF5 file structure and organization
- `list_hdf5` - Discover available HDF5 files in the directory

This prompt will:
- Use `inspect_hdf5` to analyze the file structure, groups, and datasets
- Provide detailed information about data organization and attributes
- Offer insights into the simulation data architecture and available parameters

### 2. Multi-File Scientific Data Discovery
```
Explore my research data directory at /research/experiments/ to find all HDF5 files, then inspect the structure of the most recent experimental data file.
```

**Tools called:**
- `list_hdf5` - Discover all HDF5 files in the research directory
- `inspect_hdf5` - Analyze structure of selected experimental data file

This prompt will:
- Use `list_hdf5` to discover all available HDF5 files in the research directory
- Select and inspect the structure of experimental data using `inspect_hdf5`
- Provide comprehensive overview of research data organization and contents

### 3. Data Preview and Validation
```
Before processing the large dataset at /data/sensor_measurements.hdf5, I want to preview the first 20 data points from each sensor dataset to validate the data quality.
```

**Tools called:**
- `preview_hdf5` - Preview first 20 elements from each dataset
- `inspect_hdf5` - Get detailed dataset information

This prompt will:
- Use `preview_hdf5` with count=20 to sample data from each sensor dataset
- Provide data validation insights using `inspect_hdf5` for structure analysis
- Enable quality assessment before full-scale data processing

### 4. Complete Dataset Analysis
```
I need to perform comprehensive analysis on the experimental results stored in /experiments/trial_001.h5. Extract all data from every dataset for statistical processing.
```

**Tools called:**
- `read_all_hdf5` - Read complete datasets for analysis
- `inspect_hdf5` - Get dataset metadata and structure information

This prompt will:
- Use `read_all_hdf5` to extract complete dataset contents
- Provide structure analysis using `inspect_hdf5` for context
- Enable comprehensive statistical analysis and data processing workflows

### 5. Scientific Data Exploration Workflow
```
Help me understand the contents of my computational fluid dynamics results directory at /cfd/simulations/. Show me all HDF5 files, inspect their structures, and preview key datasets.
```

**Tools called:**
- `list_hdf5` - Discover all HDF5 files in simulation directory
- `inspect_hdf5` - Analyze structure of simulation files
- `preview_hdf5` - Preview key simulation datasets

This prompt will:
- Use `list_hdf5` to discover all CFD simulation files
- Analyze file structures using `inspect_hdf5` for each simulation
- Preview key datasets using `preview_hdf5` to understand simulation outputs
- Provide comprehensive overview of computational results and data organization

### 6. Research Data Management
```
I'm organizing my laboratory data stored in HDF5 format at /lab/measurements/. List all files, inspect their structures, and provide detailed previews of measurement datasets.
```

**Tools called:**
- `list_hdf5` - Inventory all HDF5 files in laboratory directory
- `inspect_hdf5` - Detailed structure analysis of measurement files
- `preview_hdf5` - Preview measurement datasets for quality assessment

This prompt will:
- Use `list_hdf5` to create comprehensive inventory of laboratory data files
- Analyze measurement file structures using `inspect_hdf5` for metadata extraction
- Preview measurement data using `preview_hdf5` for data quality validation
- Support research data management and organization workflows
