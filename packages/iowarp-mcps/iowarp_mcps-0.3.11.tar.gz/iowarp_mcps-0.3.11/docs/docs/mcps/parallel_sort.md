### 1. Large Log File Sorting and Analysis
```
I have a large application log file at /var/logs/app.log with millions of entries. Sort this log chronologically and analyze the error patterns.
```

**Tools called:**
- `parallel_sort_large_file` - Sort the large log file using parallel processing
- `analyze_log_statistics` - Analyze log statistics and patterns
- `detect_log_patterns` - Detect error patterns and anomalies

This prompt will:
- Use `parallel_sort_large_file` to efficiently sort the large log file with optimal chunk processing
- Analyze log statistics using `analyze_log_statistics` for comprehensive metrics
- Detect patterns using `detect_log_patterns` to identify issues and trends
- Generate sorted output with detailed analysis reports

### 2. Error Log Filtering and Export
```
Filter all ERROR and WARN level entries from /var/logs/system.log from the last 24 hours and export to CSV for analysis.
```

**Tools called:**
- `filter_by_time_range` - Filter logs by time range
- `filter_by_log_level` - Filter by ERROR and WARN levels
- `export_to_csv` - Export filtered results to CSV

This prompt will:
- Filter logs by time range using `filter_by_time_range` for the last 24 hours
- Apply log level filtering using `filter_by_log_level` for ERROR and WARN entries
- Export results using `export_to_csv` with structured columns
- Provide filtered dataset ready for analysis

### 3. Connection Issue Pattern Detection
```
Analyze /var/logs/network.log for connection timeout patterns and generate a comprehensive report with trend analysis.
```

**Tools called:**
- `filter_by_keyword` - Filter for connection-related entries
- `detect_log_patterns` - Detect timeout patterns and trends
- `generate_summary_report` - Create comprehensive analysis report

This prompt will:
- Filter connection-related entries using `filter_by_keyword` with timeout keywords
- Analyze patterns using `detect_log_patterns` for anomaly detection
- Generate comprehensive report using `generate_summary_report`
- Provide trend analysis and proactive issue identification

### 4. Multi-Condition Log Analysis
```
Find all database connection errors in /var/logs/db.log that occurred during business hours (9 AM - 5 PM) and contain "timeout" or "refused".
```

**Tools called:**
- `filter_by_time_range` - Filter for business hours
- `filter_by_keyword` - Filter for timeout and connection refused
- `filter_logs` - Apply complex multi-condition filtering
- `analyze_log_statistics` - Analyze filtered results

This prompt will:
- Apply time-based filtering using `filter_by_time_range` for business hours
- Filter by keywords using `filter_by_keyword` for timeout and refused conditions
- Combine filters using `filter_logs` with logical operators
- Analyze results using `analyze_log_statistics` for comprehensive insights

### 5. Log Quality Assessment and Cleanup
```
Analyze the quality of /var/logs/application.log, identify malformed entries, and generate a clean sorted version with quality metrics.
```

**Tools called:**
- `analyze_log_statistics` - Assess log quality and identify issues
- `sort_log_by_timestamp` - Sort logs chronologically
- `generate_summary_report` - Create quality assessment report

This prompt will:
- Assess log quality using `analyze_log_statistics` with quality metrics
- Sort logs using `sort_log_by_timestamp` for chronological order
- Generate quality report using `generate_summary_report`
- Provide clean dataset with quality improvement recommendations

### 6. Historical Log Trend Analysis
```
Analyze error trends in /var/logs/historic.log over the past month, detect anomalies, and export findings to JSON for dashboard integration.
```

**Tools called:**
- `filter_by_time_range` - Filter for past month
- `detect_log_patterns` - Detect trends and anomalies
- `analyze_log_statistics` - Generate temporal analysis
- `export_to_json` - Export results for dashboard

This prompt will:
- Filter historical data using `filter_by_time_range` for the past month
- Detect trends using `detect_log_patterns` with anomaly detection
- Analyze temporal patterns using `analyze_log_statistics`
- Export findings using `export_to_json` for dashboard integration
