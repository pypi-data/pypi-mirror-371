    description="""Perform comprehensive health check and system diagnostics with advanced capability verification.

This tool provides complete system health assessment by verifying all hardware monitoring 
capabilities, system compatibility, and performance characteristics. It delivers comprehensive 
health status with diagnostic insights, optimization recommendations, and predictive maintenance guidance.

**Health Assessment Strategy**:
1. **Comprehensive Verification**: Systematically verifies all hardware monitoring capabilities and system compatibility
2. **Performance Diagnostics**: Performs comprehensive system diagnostics and performance assessment with benchmarking
3. **Capability Analysis**: Provides detailed capability status and functionality verification with compatibility testing
4. **Health Metrics**: Delivers system health metrics and optimization recommendations with trend analysis
5. **Predictive Insights**: Generates comprehensive diagnostic report with actionable insights and predictive maintenance guidance

**Health Check Components**:
- **Server Status**: Overall MCP server health and functionality verification with performance metrics
- **Capability Verification**: Individual tool functionality and system compatibility testing with detailed reporting
- **System Compatibility**: Platform compatibility and dependency verification with requirement analysis
- **Performance Assessment**: Server performance metrics and response time analysis with optimization recommendations
- **Diagnostic Insights**: System diagnostic information and health indicators with trend analysis
- **Optimization Recommendations**: System optimization suggestions and improvement strategies with implementation guidance
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Predictive maintenance insights and failure prediction with preventive recommendations

**Advanced Diagnostic Features**:
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Multi-layered capability testing with detailed error reporting and resolution guidance
- **Platform Analysis**: System compatibility analysis with platform-specific recommendations and optimization strategies
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Performance benchmarking and optimization insights with comparative analysis
- **Trend Analysis**: Health trend analysis and predictive maintenance suggestions with historical data integration
- **Troubleshooting Integration**: Diagnostic troubleshooting and problem resolution guidance with step-by-step instructions
- **Security Assessment**: Security posture analysis and vulnerability assessment with remediation recommendations

**Intelligence and Automation**:
- **Automated Diagnostics**: AI-powered diagnostic analysis with intelligent problem identification
- **Predictive Analytics**: Predictive maintenance recommendations based on system health trends
- **Optimization Intelligence**: Intelligent optimization recommendations with performance impact analysis
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Proactive health monitoring with early warning systems and alerting
- **Best Practice Integration**: Industry best practices integration with compliance checking

**Prerequisites**: No special requirements - designed for comprehensive system assessment and compatibility verification
**Tools to use before this**: None - this is typically the first tool to run for system verification
**Tools to use after this**: get_node_info() and get_remote_node_info() based on health check results and recommendations for detailed analysis

Use this tool when:
- Verifying system health and MCP server functionality ("Check system health and capabilities")
- Diagnosing system issues and compatibility problems with comprehensive analysis
- Assessing system performance and optimization opportunities with benchmarking
- Validating system capabilities and functionality before production deployment
- Troubleshooting system problems and performance issues with intelligent diagnostics
- Conducting system audits and compliance checking with best practice validation
- Planning system maintenance and optimization with predictive insights
- Establishing baseline health metrics for ongoing monitoring and trend analysis""",
