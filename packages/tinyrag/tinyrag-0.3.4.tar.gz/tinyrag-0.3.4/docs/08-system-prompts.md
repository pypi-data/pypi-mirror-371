# Custom System Prompts

Learn how to customize AI behavior in TinyRag using system prompts. This is where TinyRag becomes truly powerful for domain-specific applications.

## 🎯 What Are System Prompts?

System prompts define how the AI assistant behaves and responds. They set the personality, expertise level, and response style for your RAG application.

## 🚀 Basic Usage

### Default System Prompt

```python
from tinyrag import Provider, TinyRag

provider = Provider(api_key="sk-your-key")
rag = TinyRag(provider=provider)

# Default prompt is:
# "You are a helpful assistant. Use the provided context to answer 
#  questions accurately. If the context doesn't contain relevant 
#  information, say so."
```

### Setting Custom Prompt

#### Method 1: During Initialization

```python
custom_prompt = "You are a technical expert. Provide detailed, accurate explanations with examples."

rag = TinyRag(
    provider=provider,
    system_prompt=custom_prompt
)
```

#### Method 2: After Initialization

```python
rag = TinyRag(provider=provider)

# Update prompt later
rag.set_system_prompt("You are a helpful coding assistant specializing in Python.")

# Check current prompt
current_prompt = rag.get_system_prompt()
print(current_prompt)
```

## 🎨 Advanced Prompt Techniques

### Dynamic Prompts Based on Content

```python
def create_domain_specific_prompt(domain):
    prompts = {
        "technical": "You are a senior software engineer. Focus on implementation details and best practices.",
        "business": "You are a business analyst. Focus on strategic insights and practical applications.",
        "academic": "You are a research assistant. Provide scholarly analysis with proper citations.",
        "creative": "You are a creative consultant. Think outside the box and inspire innovation."
    }
    return prompts.get(domain, "You are a helpful assistant.")

# Use different prompts for different content types
domain = "technical"
rag = TinyRag(
    provider=provider,
    system_prompt=create_domain_specific_prompt(domain)
)
```

### Context-Aware Prompts

```python
context_prompt = """You are an adaptive assistant. Analyze the context provided and adjust your response style:

- If context contains code: Act as a programming expert
- If context contains business documents: Focus on business insights  
- If context contains academic papers: Provide scholarly analysis
- If context contains technical specs: Give implementation guidance

Always match your expertise level to the complexity of the context provided."""

rag = TinyRag(provider=provider, system_prompt=context_prompt)
```

### Multi-Language Support

```python
multilingual_prompt = """You are a multilingual assistant. 
Respond in the same language as the user's question.
If the context is in a different language than the question, 
translate relevant information while maintaining accuracy.
Clearly indicate when you're translating content."""

rag = TinyRag(provider=provider, system_prompt=multilingual_prompt)
```

## 🔧 Best Practices

### 1. Be Specific

```python
# ❌ Vague
vague_prompt = "You are helpful."

# ✅ Specific  
specific_prompt = "You are a Python development expert specializing in web frameworks. Provide code examples and explain best practices for Django and Flask applications."
```

### 2. Set Clear Boundaries

```python
bounded_prompt = """You are a technical support assistant for our software product.
ONLY answer questions about:
- Installation and setup
- Basic troubleshooting
- Feature explanations
- Configuration options

For complex technical issues, billing questions, or feature requests, 
direct users to contact our specialized support teams."""
```

### 3. Include Format Instructions

```python
formatted_prompt = """You are a documentation assistant.
Format your responses as follows:
1. Brief summary (1-2 sentences)
2. Detailed explanation with examples
3. Additional resources or next steps
4. Use bullet points for lists
5. Include code examples in markdown blocks"""
```

### 4. Handle Missing Information

```python
comprehensive_prompt = """You are a research assistant.
When the provided context doesn't contain enough information:
1. Clearly state what information is missing
2. Provide what you can based on available context
3. Suggest specific questions or resources for finding missing information
4. Never make up or assume information not in the context"""
```

## 📊 Testing Your Prompts

### A/B Testing Different Prompts

```python
# Test different prompts with same query
prompts = {
    "formal": "You are a formal business consultant. Provide professional analysis.",
    "casual": "You are a friendly advisor. Keep explanations simple and conversational.",
    "technical": "You are a technical expert. Provide detailed implementation guidance."
}

query = "How should we implement user authentication?"

for style, prompt in prompts.items():
    rag = TinyRag(provider=provider, system_prompt=prompt)
    rag.add_documents(["auth_documentation.pdf"])
    
    response = rag.chat(query)
    print(f"\n=== {style.title()} Style ===")
    print(response[:200] + "...")
```

### Measuring Response Quality

```python
# Evaluate prompt effectiveness
def evaluate_prompt(prompt, test_queries, documents):
    rag = TinyRag(provider=provider, system_prompt=prompt)
    rag.add_documents(documents)
    
    results = []
    for query in test_queries:
        response = rag.chat(query)
        # Evaluate: length, relevance, helpfulness, etc.
        results.append({
            "query": query,
            "response": response,
            "length": len(response),
            "contains_examples": "```" in response
        })
    
    return results
```

## 🚀 Real-World Applications

### Customer Service Bot

```python
# Complete customer service implementation
service_prompt = """You are a customer service representative for TechCorp.

Always:
1. Acknowledge the customer's concern
2. Provide clear, step-by-step solutions
3. Offer additional help
4. Use the customer's name if provided

For complex issues, escalate to human support with ticket number."""

rag = TinyRag(provider=provider, system_prompt=service_prompt)
rag.add_documents(["support_kb/", "product_manuals/"])

# Interactive support session
def customer_support_chat():
    print("TechCorp Support Chat - How can I help you today?")
    while True:
        question = input("\nCustomer: ")
        if question.lower() in ['exit', 'quit', 'bye']:
            print("Support: Thank you for contacting TechCorp! Have a great day!")
            break
        
        response = rag.chat(question)
        print(f"Support: {response}")

# customer_support_chat()
```
