# Chat Functionality

Build intelligent conversational interfaces with TinyRag's chat capabilities. Combine semantic search with LLM responses for powerful RAG applications.

## 🎯 What is Chat Functionality?

TinyRag's chat feature combines document search with AI language models to provide contextual, intelligent responses. It searches your documents and uses the relevant content to generate informed answers.

## 🚀 Basic Chat Setup

### Prerequisites

```python
from tinyrag import Provider, TinyRag

# Set up your AI provider first
provider = Provider(
    api_key="sk-your-openai-key",  # Replace with your key
    model="gpt-4",                 # or "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    base_url="https://api.openai.com/v1"
)

# Create TinyRag with chat capability
rag = TinyRag(provider=provider)
```

### First Chat Example

```python
# Add some documents
rag.add_documents([
    "TinyRag is a Python library for building RAG applications.",
    "It supports PDF, DOCX, CSV, and TXT file processing.",
    "Vector stores include Memory, Pickle, Faiss, and ChromaDB.",
    "The library works locally using embeddings from HuggingFace."
])

# Have a conversation
response = rag.chat("What is TinyRag and what can it do?")
print(response)

# Follow-up questions work naturally
response2 = rag.chat("What file formats does it support?")
print(response2)
```

### Understanding the Chat Process

```python
# The chat process involves:
# 1. Search your documents for relevant content
# 2. Provide that content as context to the AI
# 3. Generate a response based on the context
# 4. Return the AI's answer

# You can see this in action:
query = "How do vector stores work?"

# Step 1: See what documents are found
search_results = rag.query(query, k=3)
print("Found documents:")
for text, score in search_results:
    print(f"Score: {score:.2f} - {text[:100]}...")

# Step 2: Get AI response using those documents
chat_response = rag.chat(query)
print(f"\nAI Response: {chat_response}")
```

## 💬 Chat Patterns and Use Cases

### 1. Document Q&A System

```python
# Load comprehensive documentation
rag = TinyRag(provider=provider, vector_store="faiss")
rag.add_documents([
    "user_manual.pdf",
    "api_documentation/",
    "faq.txt",
    "troubleshooting_guide.docx"
])

# Interactive Q&A session
def interactive_qa():
    print("Document Q&A System - Ask me anything!")
    print("Type 'quit' to exit.\n")
    
    while True:
        question = input("Question: ")
        if question.lower() in ['quit', 'exit', 'q']:
            break
        
        try:
            answer = rag.chat(question)
            print(f"Answer: {answer}\n")
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}\n")

# interactive_qa()
```

### 2. Code Assistant

```python
# Set up code-focused assistant
code_prompt = """You are a helpful programming assistant. 
Analyze the provided code context and give practical, actionable advice.
Include code examples in your responses when helpful."""

code_rag = TinyRag(
    provider=provider,
    system_prompt=code_prompt,
    vector_store="faiss"
)

# Index codebase
code_rag.add_codebase("my_project/")

# Code-related conversations
coding_questions = [
    "How is user authentication implemented?",
    "Show me the database connection code",
    "What testing framework is used?",
    "How can I add a new API endpoint?",
    "Are there any security vulnerabilities in the auth code?"
]

print("=== Code Assistant ===")
for question in coding_questions:
    print(f"\nQ: {question}")
    answer = code_rag.chat(question)
    print(f"A: {answer}")
```

### 3. Customer Support Bot

```python
# Customer support configuration
support_prompt = """You are a friendly customer support representative.
Always be helpful, empathetic, and solution-focused.
Use the provided documentation to help resolve customer issues.
If you cannot find an answer, politely suggest contacting human support."""

support_rag = TinyRag(
    provider=provider,
    system_prompt=support_prompt,
    vector_store="memory"
)

# Load support knowledge base
support_rag.add_documents([
    "product_features.txt",
    "billing_information.pdf", 
    "technical_troubleshooting.docx",
    "shipping_policies.txt"
])

# Support conversation simulation
support_scenarios = [
    "I can't log into my account",
    "How do I cancel my subscription?", 
    "My order hasn't arrived yet",
    "The app keeps crashing on my phone",
    "I was charged twice for the same order"
]

print("=== Customer Support Bot ===")
for scenario in support_scenarios:
    print(f"\nCustomer: {scenario}")
    response = support_rag.chat(scenario)
    print(f"Support: {response}")
```

### 4. Research Assistant

```python
# Research-focused assistant
research_prompt = """You are a research assistant helping with academic and professional research.
Provide thorough, well-researched answers with proper context.
Cite the relevant information from the provided sources.
Be objective and analytical in your responses."""

research_rag = TinyRag(
    provider=provider,
    system_prompt=research_prompt,
    vector_store="chromadb"
)

# Add research materials
research_rag.add_documents([
    "research_papers/",
    "academic_journals/",
    "industry_reports/",
    "conference_proceedings/"
])

# Research queries
research_questions = [
    "What are the latest developments in machine learning?",
    "Summarize the key findings on climate change impacts",
    "What methodologies are used in user experience research?",
    "Compare different approaches to data privacy protection"
]

print("=== Research Assistant ===")
for question in research_questions:
    print(f"\nResearch Query: {question}")
    analysis = research_rag.chat(question)
    print(f"Analysis: {analysis}\n" + "="*50)
```

## 🎨 Advanced Chat Features
