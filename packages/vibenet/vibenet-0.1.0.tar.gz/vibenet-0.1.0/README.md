A while ago I canceled my Spotify subscription and began building my own offline music library. But something I always missed was Spotify's ability to generate smart playlists like *Morning Mix* or *Driving Vibes*. Spotify doesn't publish how its algorithm creates these playlists, so I set out to build my own system.

VibeNet is a lightweight all-in-one Python package, [Beets plugin](https://beets.io/), and command-line tool that predicts musical emotions and attributes (valence, energy, danceability, acousticness, etc.) directly from raw audio. It utilizes a distilled EfficientNet student model trained with teacher-student distillation on the Free Music Archive (FMA) dataset.

To get started, install the VibeNet package.
```
pip install vibenet
```
Then, follow the quick links below.

## Quick Links

There are a few different ways to use VibeNet depending on your intended use case.

- [Beets plugin](#beets-plugin) - By far the best option for using VibeNet to tag and classify your personal music collection
- MusicBrainz Picard - Coming soon!
- [Python package]() - Best if you want to build on top VibeNet or you need the maximum flexibility
- [Command line (CLI)](#command-line) - Best for one-off labeling tasks and general usage.

## What attributes are predicted?

VibeNet predicts 7 continuous attributes for each audio track: **acousticness**, **danceability**, **energy**, **instrumentalness**, **liveness**, **speechiness**, and **valence**.

Some features (like acousticness, instrumentalness, and liveness) are **likelihoods**: they represent probabilities of that characteristic being present (e.g. probability the track is acoustic). Others (like danceability, energy, valence) are **continuous descriptors**: they describe how much of the quality the track has.

For example, an acousticness value of 0.85 doesn't mean that 85% of the track is composed of acoustic instruments. It means that it's highly likely that the recording is acoustic and not electronic.

Conversely, an energy value of 0.15 doesn't mean that it's highly unlikely that the song is energetic. It reflects a degree of the quality itself, meaning that the track is overall perceived as having very low intensity.

Below is a table describing each attribute in more detail:

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Acousticness** | Likelihood | A measure of how likely a track is to be acoustic rather than electronically produced. High values indicate recordings that rely on natural, unprocessed sound sources (e.g. solo guitar, piano ballad, etc.). Low values indicate tracks that are primarily electronic or produced with synthetic instrumentation (e.g. EDM, trap, etc.) 
| **Instrumentalness** | Likelihood | Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. Higher values suggest that the track contains no vocal content (e.g. symphonies), while lower values indicate the the presence of sung or spoken vocals (e.g. rap).
| **Liveness** | Likelihood | A measure of how likely the track is to be a recording of a live performance. Higher values suggest the presence of live-performance characteristics (crowd noise, reverberation, stage acoustics), while lower values suggest a studio recording.
| **Danceability** | Descriptor | Describes how suitable a track is for dancing. Tracks with higher values (closer to 1.0) tend to feel more danceable while, lower values (closer to 0.0) may feel less danceable.
| **Energy** | Descriptor | Also known as arousal. Measures the perceived intensity and activity level of a track. Higher values indicate tracks that feel fast, loud, and powerful, while lower values indicate tracks that feel calm, soft, or subdued.
| **Valence** | Descriptor | Measures the musical positivity conveyed by a track. Higher values indicate tracks that sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while lower values  indicate tracks that sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
| **Speechiness** | Descriptor | Measures the presence of spoken words in a track. Higher values indicate that the recording is more speech-like (e.g. podcasts), while lower values suggest that the audio is more musical, with singing or purely instrumental content. Mid-range values often correspond to tracks that mix both elements, such as spoken-word poetry layered over music.

## Usage
### Beets Plugin
This option is best for tagging a large music library, for example if you want to create playlists organized by mood.

[beets](https://beets.io/) is a powerful program for managing your music library. If you have a large collection of mp3/flac files, you're probably already familiar with this tool. If you aren't, I would recommend you first visit https://beets.io and take a moment to learn your way around the tool.

#### Installation

Install the VibeNet package into the same virtual environment as your beets installation

```
pip install vibenet
```

and activate the plugin by adding it to your beets configuration (Run `beet config -e` to edit your config file)

```
plugins:
    - vibenet
```

#### Configuration
To configure the plugin, make a `vibenet:` section in your beets configuration file. For example:
```
vibenet:
    auto: yes
    force: no
    threads: 0
```

- **auto**: Enable VibeNet during `beet import`. Default: `yes`
- **force**: Perform prediction on tracks that already have all fields. Default: `no`
- **threads**: The number of CPU threads to use for inference. Default: all available threads

#### Usage
By default, the plugin tags files automatically during import. You can optionally run the vibenet command manually. For a list of all CLI options:

```
beet vibenet --help
```

Once your files are tagged, you can do some pretty cool things with beets. For example, if I wanted to find all songs by ABBA with a high valence score:

```
beet ls artist:=ABBA valence:0.7..
```

Or to build a party playlist of upbeat tracks:

```
beet ls valence:0.6.. energy:0.7..
```

Or maybe a calm but inspirational study playlist composed of instrumental tracks:

```
beet ls instrumentalness:0.9.. energy:..0.3 valence:0.8..
```

To get the most out of beets, you should understand [how its query strings work](https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/query.html).

#### Installation
Install the VibeNet package.

```
pip install vibenet
```

#### Usage
Check the Model class in `vibenet/core.py` for full details. Below are a few examples:

**Inference on a single audio file**
```py
from vibenet import load_model

model = load_model()
print(model.predict("Dancing Queen.flac"))
```
```
[InferenceResult(acousticness=0.34442428835652833, danceability=0.6195424795150757, energy=0.7037929892539978, instrumentalness=0.7138845214492101, liveness=0.1604615680649649, speechiness=0.04466772451996803, valence=0.8822445869445801)]
```

**Inference on multiple audio files**
```py
from vibenet import load_model

model = load_model()
print(model.predict(["Dancing Queen.flac", "Money, Money, Money.flac"]))
```
```
[InferenceResult(acousticness=0.34442428835652833, danceability=0.6195424795150757, energy=0.7037929892539978, instrumentalness=0.7138845214492101, liveness=0.1604615680649649, speechiness=0.04466772451996803, valence=0.8822445869445801), InferenceResult(acousticness=0.6901674220217361, danceability=0.6556591987609863, energy=0.4812447428703308, instrumentalness=0.7523727231956888, liveness=0.14662341130452025, speechiness=0.06765997409820557, valence=0.9115567207336426)]
```

The input to the `predict` method can be an array of file paths or raw waveforms (`np.ndarray`). If the inputs are waveforms, the sample rate must be provided as well. The output of the `predict` method is an array of `InferenceResult`, with the index of each output corresponding to the respective index in the input.
