Changes in gmpy2 2.1.0rc1
-------------------------

* Added support for embedded underscore characters in string literals.
* Allow GIL release for `mpz`/`xmpz`/`mpq` types only.

Changes in gmpy2 2.1.0b6
------------------------

* Improve argument type processing by saving type information to
  decrease the number of type check calls. Especially helpful
  for `mpfr` and `mpc` types. (Not complete but common operations
  are done.)
* Resolve bug in `mpfr` to `mpq` conversion; issue #287.
* Added limited support for releasing the GIL; disabled by default;
  see `context.allow_release_gil`.
* Refactored handling of inplace operations for `mpz` and `xmpz` types;
  inplace operations on `xmpz` will only return an `xmpz` result.
* Refactored handling of conversion to C integer types. Some
  exception types changes to reflect Python types.
* `gcd()` and `lcm()` now support more than two arguments to align with
  the corresponding functions in the math module.

Changes in gmpy2 2.1.0b5
------------------------

* Avoid MPFR bug in mfr_fac_ui (`factorial()`) on platforms where
  long is 32-bits and argument is >= 44787929.
* Fixed testing bugs with Python 2.7.
* Fixed ``mpz(0)`` to C long or long long.

Changes in gmpy2 2.1.0b3
------------------------

* Version bump only.

Changes in gmpy2 2.1.0b2
------------------------

* Many bug fixes.

Changes in gmpy2 2.1.0b1
------------------------

* Added `cmp()` and `cmp_abs()`.
* Improved compatibility with the :mod:`numbers` module protocol.
* Many bug fixes.

Changes in gmpy2 2.1.a05
------------------------

* Fix `qdiv()` not returning `mpz` when it should.
* Added `root_of_unity()`.

Changes in gmpy2 2.1.0a4
------------------------

* Fix issue 204; missing file for Cython.
* Additional support for MPFR 4

   - Add `fmma()` and `fmms()`.

Changes in gmpy2 2.1.0a3
------------------------

* Updates to ``setup.py``.
* Initial support for MPFR4

   - Add `mpfr_nrandom()`
   - `mpfr_grandom()` now calls nrandom twice; may return different values
     versus MPFR3.
   - Add `rootn()`; same as `root()` except different sign when taking even
     root of -0.0.

Changes in gmpy2 2.1.0a2
------------------------

* Revised build process.
* Removal of unused code/macros.
* Cleanup of Cython interface.

Changes in gmpy2 2.1.0a1
------------------------

* Thread-safe contexts are now supported. Properly integrating thread-safe
  contexts required an extensive rewrite of almost all internal functions.
* MPFR and MPC are now required. It is no longer possible to build a version
  of gmpy2 that only supports the GMP library.
* The function ``inverse()`` now raises an exception if the inverse does not
  exist.
* Context methods have been added for MPFR/MPC related functions.
* A new context option (`~context.rational_division`) has been added that
  changes the behavior of integer division involving `mpz` instances to return
  a rational result instead of a floating-point result.
* gmpy2 types are now registered in the numeric tower of the
  :mod:`numbers` module.
* In previous versions of gmpy2, ``mpz()`` was a factory function that
  returned an  `mpz` instance.  It is now an actual type. The same
  is true for the other gmpy2 types.
* If a Python object has an ``__mpz__`` method, it will be called bye ``mpz()``
  to allow an unrecognized type to be converted to an mpz instance. The same is
  true for the other gmpy2 types.
* A new C-API and Cython interface has been added.

Changes in gmpy2 2.0.4
----------------------

* Fix `bit_scan0()` for negative values.
* Changes to ``setup.py`` to allow static linking.
* Fix performance regression with mpmath and Python 3.

Changes in gmpy2 2.0.3

* Correct ``InvalidOperation`` exception not raised in certain circumstances.
* `invert()` now raises an exception if the modular inverse does not exist.
* Fixed internal exception in `is_bpsw_prp()` and `is_strong_bpsw_prp()`.
* Updated `is_extra_strong_lucas_prp()` to latest version.

Changes in gmpy2 2.0.0
----------------------

* Fix segmentation fault in ``_mpmath_normalize()`` (an undocumented helper
  function for mpmath).  (casevh)
* Fix issues when compiled without support for MPFR.  (casevh)
* Conversion of too large an `mpz` to `float` now raises `OverflowError`
  instead of returning ``inf``.  (casevh)
* Renamed ``min2()/max2()`` to `minnum()`/`maxnum()`.  (casevh)
* The build and install process (i.e. ``setup.py``) has been completely
  rewritten.  See the Installation section for more information.  (casevh)
* `get_context()` no longer accepts keyword arguments.  (casevh)

Known issues in gmpy2 2.0.0
-----------------------------

* The test suite is still incomplete.

Changes in gmpy2 2.0.0b4
------------------------

* Added ``__ceil__()``, ``__floor__()``, ``__trunc__()``, and ``__round__()``
  methods to `mpz` and `mpq` types.  (casevh)
* Added ``__complex__()`` to `mpc` type.  (casevh)
* ``round(mpfr)`` now correctly returns an `mpz` type.  (casevh)
* Add mpz.denominator and mpz.numerator.  (casevh)
* If no arguments are given to `mpz`, `mpq`, `mpfr`, `mpc`, and `xmpz`,
  return 0 of the appropriate type.  (casevh)
* Fix broken comparison between `mpz` and `mpq` when `mpz` is on
  the left.  (casevh)
* Added ``__sizeof__()`` to all types. Note: :func:`sys.getsizeof` calls
  ``__sizeof__()`` to get the memory size of a gmpy2 object. The returned
  value reflects the size of the allocated memory which may be larger than
  the actual minimum memory required by the object.  (casevh)

Known issues in gmpy2 2.0.0b4
-----------------------------

* The new test suite (``test/runtest.py``) is incomplete and some tests fail on
  Python 2.x due to formatting issues.

Changes in gmpy2 2.0.0b3
------------------------

* `mp_version()`, `mpc_version()`, and `mpfr_version()` now return normal
  strings on Python 2.x instead of Unicode strings.  (casevh)

* Fixed the various ``is_XXX()`` tests when used with `mpc`.  (casevh)
* Fixed error handling with mpc(); mpc(1,"nan") is properly handled.  (casevh)
* Added caching for `mpc` objects.  (casevh)
* Faster code path for basic operation is both operands are `mpfr`
  or `mpc`.  (casevh)
* Fix `mpfr` + `float` segmentation fault.  (casevh)

Changes in gmpy2 2.0.0b2

* Allow `xmpz` slice assignment to increase length of `xmpz` instance by
  specifying a value for stop.  (casevh)
* Fixed reference counting bug in several ``is_xxx_prp()`` tests.  (casevh)
* Added `~xmpz.iter_bits()`, `~xmpz.iter_clear()`, `~xmpz.iter_set()` methods
  to `xmpz`.  (casevh)
* Added `powmod()` for easy access to three argument :func:`pow()`.  (casevh)
* Removed ``addmul()`` and ``submul()`` which were added in 2.0.0b1 since they
  are slower than just using Python code.  (casevh)
* Bug fix in gcd_ext when both arguments are not `mpz`.  (casevh)
* Added `ieee()` to create contexts for 32, 64, or 128 bit `float`'s.  (casevh)

* Allow building with just GMP/MPIR if MPFR not available.  (casevh)
* Allow building with GMP/MPIR and MPFR if MPC not available.  (casevh)
* Removed most instance methods in favor of gmpy2.function. The general
  guideline is that *properties* of an instance can be done via instance
  methods but *functions* that return a new result are done using
  gmpy2.function.  (casevh)
* Added ``__ceil__()``, ``__floor__()``, and ``__trunc__()`` methods since they
  are called by :func:`math.ceil()`, :func:`math.floor()`, and

thanks all!

* fixed bug of '"%d" where "%ld" was meant' in many places
  and other sundry minor warnings given by gcc
* fixed hash (delegating to Python) so mp[nqz](x) will
  produce the same value as hash(x) for any Python number x
