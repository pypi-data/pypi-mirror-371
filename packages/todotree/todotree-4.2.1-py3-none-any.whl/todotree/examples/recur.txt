# This is an example recur.txt file.
# Lines starting with a # are ignored and can be used as comments.
# This file is used to define recurring tasks, such as doing taxes or remembering to buy milk.
# Each line is a separate task on a separate schedule.
# An example line is the following:
2020-01-01 ; 2030-01-01 ; yearly - (C) Celebrate new year.
# It has four components, seperated by two ; and one -
# <start date> ; <end date> ; interval - task
# The interval can be Never, Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Yearly.
# The end date is optional:
2020-01-01 ;; daily - (A) run todotree recur +todotree
# But do not forget the double ;; in that case.
# This line is run only once and will run the first time that you run recur:
2020-01-01 ;; never - (A) Add recurring tasks to recur.txt +todotree
