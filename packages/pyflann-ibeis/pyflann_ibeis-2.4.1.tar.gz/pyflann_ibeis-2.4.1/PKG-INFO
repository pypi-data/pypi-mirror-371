This is a Fork of the FLANN repo, under a different name for use in the IBEIS
project. The main difference is that it has a few more helper function calls
and it should be easier build wheels and to pip install.


FLANN - Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors
======================================================

FLANN is a library for performing fast approximate nearest neighbor searches in high dimensional spaces. It contains a collection of algorithms we found to work best for nearest neighbor search and a system for automatically choosing the best algorithm and optimum parameters depending on the dataset.
FLANN is written in C++ and contains bindings for the following languages: C, MATLAB, Python, and Ruby.


Documentation
-------------

Check FLANN web page [here](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/research/flann).

Documentation on how to use the library can be found in the doc/manual.pdf file included in the release archives.

More information and experimental results can be found in the following paper:

  * Marius Muja and David G. Lowe, "Fast Approximate Nearest Neighbors with Automatic Algorithm Configuration", in International Conference on Computer Vision Theory and Applications (VISAPP'09), 2009 [(PDF)](http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~mariusm/uploads/FLANN/flann_visapp09.pdf) [(BibTex)](http://people.cs.ubc.ca/~mariusm/index.php/FLANN/BibTex)


Getting FLANN
-------------

If you want to try out the latest changes or contribute to FLANN, then it's recommended that you checkout the git source repository: `git clone git://github.com/mariusmuja/flann.git`

If you just want to browse the repository, you can do so by going [here](https://github.com/mariusmuja/flann).
